chainladder: Property and Casualty Loss Reserving in Python
------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome! The chainladder package was built to be able to handle all of your actuarial needs in python. It consists of popular actuarial tools, such as triangle data manipulation, link ratios calculation, and IBNR estimates with both deterministic and stochastic models. We build this package so you no longer have to rely on outdated softwares and tools when performing actuarial pricing or reserving indications.

This package strives to be minimalistic in needing its own API. The syntax mimics popular packages `pandas`_ for data manipulation and `scikit-learn`_ for model
construction. An actuary that is already familiar with these tools will be able to pick up this package with ease. You will be able to save your mental energy for actual actuarial work.

Chainladder is built by a group of volunteers, and we need YOUR help!

Installation
------------

There are two ways to install the chainladder package, using `pip` or `conda`:

1) Using `pip`:

``pip install chainladder``

2) Using `conda`:

``conda install -c conda-forge chainladder``

If you would like to try pre-release features, install the package directly from GitHub.

``pip install git+https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/``




Getting Started
-------------------------

The package comes pre-loaded with sample insurance datasets that are publicly available. We have also drafted tutorials that use the chainladder package on these datasets to demonstrate some of the commonly used functionalities that the package offers.

Once you have the package installed, we recommend that you follow the starter tutorial and work alongside with the pre-loaded datasets.

Note that a lot of the examples shown might not be applicable in a real world scenario, and is only meant to demonstrate some of the functionalities included in the package. The user should always follow all applicable laws, the Code of Professional Conduct, applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice, and exercise their best actuarial judgement.

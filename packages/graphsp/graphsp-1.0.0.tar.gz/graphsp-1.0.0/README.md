# Graphsp

## Project description

This project implements algorithms associated with `Graph Data Structure`.

The following is the list of algorithm this library implements:

- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Dijkstra (Single Source Shortest Path)
- Floyd Warshall (All Pairs Shortest Path)

## Installation

`pip install graphsp`

## Usage

`from graphsp import Graph`

Initializing graph object

```
graph = graphsp.Graph(n, graph_type)
```

- n = Total number of nodes
- graph_type = directed / undirected [in string]

Initializing & Populating the graph

```
graph = graphsp.Graph(5, "undirected")

graph.bulk_link([(0, 4, 5), (0, 1, 1), (1, 4, 3),
                 (1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 15), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 3)])

print(graph.detect_cycle())
```

Using different algorithms

```
dfs = DFS(n, graph)
print(dfs.dfs(start_node))

bfs = BFS(n, graph)
print(bfs.bfs(start_node))

dj = Dijkstra(n, graph)
print(dj.dijkstra(start_node))

bf = BellmanFord(n, graph)
print(bf.bellman_ford(start_node))

fw = FloydWarshall(n, graph)
print(fw.floyd_warshall())

ts = TopoSorting(n, graph)
print(ts.topo_sorting())

pr = Prim(n, graph)
print(pr.prim())

ks = Kruskal(n, graph)
print(ks.kruskal())

kr = Kosaraju(n, graph)
print(kr.kosaraju())
```

- n = Total number of nodes
- start_node = Number on the desired starting node
- graph = Object of Graph class

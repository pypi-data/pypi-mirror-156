# Developing the CLI

The command-line interface is implemented using Click and setuptools. To install it locally for development inside your virtual environment, run the following installation command, as [prescribed by the Click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/setuptools/#setuptools-integration).

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

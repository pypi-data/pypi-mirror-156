DACCURACY_DESCRIPTION = """3 modes:
    - one-to-one: one ground-truth (csv, image, or Numpy array) vs. one detection (image or Numpy array)
    - one-to-many: one ground-truth vs. several detections (folder of detections)
    - many-to-many: several ground-truths (folder of ground-truths) vs. corresponding detections (folder of detections)

In many-to-many mode, each detection file must have a counterpart ground-truth file with the same name, but not
necessarily the same extension.
"""

MEASURES_DESCRIPTIONS = """
"Pointwise" Measures: Measures accounting for presence or absence only (object shapes are not accounted for).
    true_positive: Number of detected objects present in ground-truth
    false_positive: Number of detected objects not present in ground-truth
    false_negative: Number of ground-truth objects not present in detection
    precision (a.k.a. positive predictive value)=true_positive / (true_positive + false_positive): Correctness among detected objects
    recall (a.k.a. sensitivity, true positive rate, hit rate)=true_positive / (true_positive + false_negative): Exhaustiveness of detected objects
    f1_score=2.0 * precision * recall / (precision + recall): Harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity; best=1, worst=0
    froc_sample=One sample of the Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) curve: (false_positive, recall)

Region Measures: Measures accounting for presence/absence and shape. They are meaningful only if the ground-truth is specified through an image, not a CSV file. They are computed for each detected object, then averaged (standard deviation, minimum, and maximum are also computed). Notations: gt=ground-truth, dn=detection.
    overlap=100.0 * intersection_area_between_gt_and_dn / min(gt_area, dn_area): perfect match=>100; total miss=>0
    jaccard=intersection_area_between_gt_and_dn / union_area_of_gt_and_dn: perfect match=>1; total miss=>0
    precision_p (pixelwise-precision)=intersection_area_between_gt_and_dn / dn_area: perfect match=>1; total miss=>0
    recall_p (pixelwise-recall)=intersection_area_between_gt_and_dn / gt_area: perfect match=>1; total miss=>0
    f1_score_p (pixelwise-f1 score)

Checking Values: Values useful for checking the coherence between some measures.
    check_tp_fn_equal_gt=true_positive + false_negative: Must be equal to the number of ground-truth objects
    check_tp_fp_equal_dn=true_positive + false_positive: Must be equal to the number of detected objects
    dn_2_gt_associations: Python dictionary of the ground-truth labels (dictionary values) associated with the detection labels (dictionary keys)

Notes:
    Accuracy=(true_positive + true_negative) / (true_positive + true_negative + false_positive + false_negative): Cannot be computed since the number of true negatives has no meaning in the context of DAccuracy.
    Specificity (a.k.a. selectivity, true negative rate)=true_negative / (true_negative + false_positive): Cannot be computed. See note on Accuracy.
    Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve: Curve of the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate (equal to: 1 − specificity). Since the specificity cannot be computed, so does the ROC curve samples.
    Free-response ROC (FROC) curve: Alternative to the ROC curve obtained by replacing the false positive rate with the number of false positives when true negatives cannot be defined.

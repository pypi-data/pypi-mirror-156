_it may not be useful for you but for me it was a good help_ 💡

---------------------------------

## 🔹Features

- Using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) for scraping the titles of the links
- Using [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and [questionary](https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for CLI
- You can choose between `headless` and `normal` mode for browser behaviour
- Creates a new file with the date for name to log the results
- You can easily give it any file that contains several links that are unknown to you

---------------------------------

## 🔹Requirements

- `Python 3.7+`
- `typer`
- `questionary`
- `selenium`
  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

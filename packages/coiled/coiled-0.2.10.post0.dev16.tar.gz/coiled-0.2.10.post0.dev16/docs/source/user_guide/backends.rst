Coiled manages launching Dask clusters and creating software environments for
you. You can run Coiled on from your own AWS or GCP account.
This allows you to make use of security/data access controls, compliance standards,
and promotional credits that you already have in place.

Coiled is only responsible for provisioning resources for
clusters you create. Once a Dask cluster is created, all computations,
data transfer, and client-to-scheduler communication occurs entirely
within your cloud provider account.

            the result of an ECDH exchange.  The process does not move forward

        If the server provisionally accepts the ECDH exchange, then the
        verification_callback will be called (with an empty peer name and the
        completed ECDH exchange).  The callback can then decide whether the
        exchange is verified, and return True -- or reject the exchange,
        in which case it must return False (then this raises RejectedBySelf).

        At the end of a successful process, it returns the certificate issued
        to your code, as well as the certificate chain for the root of trust
        you can use to verify the authenticated server.

        If the server rejected the ECDH exchange or otherwise failed to perform
        the exchange or issue the cert, an exception RejectedByPeer is raised.

Description: # Light Pandas
        
        ## Brief
        
        **Pandas** is a great tools for data analysis.<br>
        But the execution speed is very slow. So I try to provide a light library.
        The properties as below:
        
        - **Light Pandas** only provide part of functions which provided by pandas.
        - The code can compactible pandas. That's mean the code should execute OK if replaced light pandas by pandas.
        - **Light Pandas** execution speed is faster than pandas.
        - The cell type only provide str.
        - TBD

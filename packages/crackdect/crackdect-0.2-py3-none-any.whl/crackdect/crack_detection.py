"""
Crack detection algorithms

These module contains the different functions for the crack detection. This includes functions for different
sub-algorithms which are used in the final crack detection as well as different methods for the crack detection.
The different crack detection methods are available as functions with an image stack and additional arguments
as input.

    differ vastly in width lean more to the thinner cracks to get a reasonable approximation.

class CrackDetectionTWLI:
    r"""
    The basic method from Glud et al. for crack detection without preprocessing.

    This is the basis for a crack detection with this method. Each object from this class
    can be used to detect cracks from images. The workflow of objects from this class is quite easy.

    #. Object instantiation. Create an object from with the input parameter for the crack detection.
    #. Call the method :meth:`~.detect_cracks` with an image as input.
       This method will call all sub-functions of the crack detection.

       #. apply the gabor filter
       #. apply otsuÂ´s threshold to split the image into foreground and background.
       #. skeletonize the foreground
       #. find the cracks in the skeletonized image.

    Shift detection, normalization, and other preprocessing procedures are not performed! It is assumed that
    all the necessary preprocessing is already done for the input image. For preprocessing please use
    the :mod:`~.stack_operations` or other means.

    Parameters
    ----------
    theta: float
        Angle of the cracks in respect to a horizontal line in degrees
    frequency: float, optional
        Frequency of the gabor filter. Default: 0.1
    bandwidth: float, optional
        The bandwidth of the gabor filter, Default: 1
    sigma_x: float, optional
        Standard deviation of the gabor kernel in x-direction. This applies to the kernel before rotation. The
        kernel is then rotated *theta* degrees.
    sigma_y: float, optional
        Standard deviation of the gabor kernel in y-direction. This applies to the kernel before rotation. The
        kernel is then rotated *theta* degrees.
    n_stds: int, optional
        The size of the gabor kernel in standard deviations. A smaller kernel is faster but also less accurate.
        Default: 3
    min_size: int, optional
        The minimal number of pixels a crack can be. Cracks under this size will not get counted. Default: 1
    threshold: str
        Method of determining the threshold between foreground and background. Choose between 'otsu' or 'yen'.
        Generally, yen is not as sensitive as otsu. For blurry images with lots of noise yen is nearly always
        better than otsu.
    sensitivity: float, optional
        Adds or subtracts x percent of the input image range to the threshold. E.g. sensitivity=-10 will lower
        the threshold to determine foreground by 10 percent of the input image range. For crack detection with
        bad image quality or lots of artefacts it can be helpful to lower the sensitivity to avoid too much false
        detections.

class CrackDetectionBender:
    r"""
    Base class for the crack detection `method by J.J. Bender
    <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350967596_Effect_of_variable_amplitude_block_loading_on_intralaminar_crack_initiation_and_propagation_in_multidirectional_GFRP_laminate>`_.

    This crack detection algorithm only works on an image stack with consecutive images of one specimen.
    The first image is used as the background image.
    No cracks are detected in the first image. The images must be aligned for this algorithm to
    work correctly. Cracks can only be detected in grayscale images with the same shape.

    Following filters are applied to the images:
    1: Apply image history. Images must become darker with time. This subsequently reduces noise in the imagestack
    2: Image division with reference image (first image of the stack) to remove constant objects.
    3: The image is divided by a blurred version of itself to remove the background.
    4: A directional Gaussian filter is applied to diminish cracks in other directions.
    5: Images are sharpened with an `unsharp_mask <https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/filters/plot_unsharp_mask.html>`_.
    6: A threshold is applied to remove falsely identified cracks or artefacts with a weak signal.
    7: Morphological closing of the image with a crack-like footprint.
    8: Binarization of the image
    9: The n-1st binaritzed image is added.
    10: Finde the cracks with the skeletonizing and scanning method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    theta: float
        Angle of the cracks in respect to a horizontal line in degrees
    crack_width: int
        The approximate width of an average crack in pixel. This determines the width of the detected features.
    threshold: float, optional
        Threshold of what is perceived as a crack after all filters. E.g. 0.96 means that all gray values over 0.96
        in the filtered image are cracks. This value should be close to 1. A lower value will detect cracks with a
        weak signal but more artefacts as well. Default: 5
    min_size: int, optional
        The minimal number of pixels a crack can be. Cracks under this size will not get counted. Default: 5

    """
    Crack detection based on a simpler version of the algorithm by J.A. Glud.
    All images are treated separately.

    Parameters
    ----------
    images: ImageStack, list
        Image stack or list of grayscale images on which the crack detection will be performed. This algorithm treats
        each image separately as no image influences the results of the other images.
    theta: float
        Angle of the cracks in respect to a horizontal line in degrees
    crack_width: int
        The approximate width of an average crack in pixel. This determines the width of the detected features.
    ar: float
        The aspect ratio of the gabor kernel. Since cracks are a lot longer than wide a longer gabor kernel will
        automatically detect cracks easier and artifacts are filtered out better. A too large aspect ratio will
        result in an big kernel which slows down the computation. Default: 2
    bandwidth: float, optional
        The bandwidth of the gabor filter, Default: 1
    n_stds: int, optional
        The size of the gabor kernel in standard deviations. A smaller kernel is faster but also less accurate.
        Default: 3
    min_size: int, optional
        The minimal number of pixels a crack can be. Cracks under this size will not get counted. Default: 5
    threshold: str
        Method of determining the threshold between foreground and background. Choose between 'otsu' or 'yen'.
        Generally, yen is not as sensitive as otsu. For blurry images with lots of noise yen is nearly always
        better than otsu.
    sensitivity: float, optional
        Adds or subtracts x percent of the input image range to the Otsu-threshold. E.g. sensitivity=-10 will lower
        the threshold to determine foreground by 10 percent of the input image range. For crack detection with
        bad image quality or lots of artefacts it can be helpful to lower the sensitivity to avoid too much false
        detections.

    Returns
    -------
    rho_c: float
        Crack density [1/px]
    cracks: np.ndarray
        Array with the coordinates of the crack with the following structure:
        ([[x0, y0],[x1,y1], [...]]) where x0 and y0 are the starting coordinates and x1, y1
        the end of one crack. Each crack is represented by a 2x2 array stacked into a bigger array (x,2,2).
    rho_th: float
        A measure how much of the area of the input image is detected as foreground. If the gabor filter can not
        distinguish between cracks with very little space in between the crack detection will break down and
        lead to false results. If this value is high but the crack density is low, this is an indicator that
        the crack detection does not work with the given input parameters and the input image.

    This crack detection algorithm only works on an image stack with consecutive images of one specimen.
    In contrast to the original algorithm from J.A. Glud, no change detection is applied in this implementation since
    it can be easily applied as a preprocessing step if needed (see :mod:`~.stack_operations`)

    This crack detection algorithm only works on an image stack with consecutive images of one specimen.
    The first image is used as the background image.
    No cracks are detected in the first image. The images must be aligned for this algorithm to
    work correctly. Cracks can only be detected in grayscale images with the same shape.

        Angle of the cracks in respect to a horizontal line in degrees
    crack_width: int
        The approximate width of an average crack in pixel. This determines the width of the detected features.
    threshold: float, optional
        Threshold of what is perceived as a crack after all filters. E.g. 0.96 means that all gray values over 0.96
        in the filtered image are cracks. This value should be close to 1. A lower value will detect cracks with a
        weak signal but more artefacts as well. Default: 5
    min_size: int, optional
        The minimal number of pixels a crack can be. Cracks under this size will not get counted. Default: 5

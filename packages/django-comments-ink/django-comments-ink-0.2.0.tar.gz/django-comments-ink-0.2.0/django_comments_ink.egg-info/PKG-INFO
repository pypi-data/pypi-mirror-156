It extends [django-contrib-comments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-contrib-comments) with the following features:

- Thread support, so comments can be nested.
- Customizable maximum thread level, either for all models or on a per app.model basis.
- Optional notifications on follow-up comments via email.
- Mute links to allow cancellation of follow-up notifications.
- Comment confirmation via email when users are not authenticated.
- Comments hit the database only after they have been confirmed.
- Registered users can send reactions to comments, as like/dislike, or other customizable set of reactions.
- Registered users can suggest comment's removal.
- Comment pagination support.
- Template tags to list comments and to add the comment form.
- Emails sent through threads (can be disable to allow other solutions, like a Celery app).
- Fully functional JavaScript plugin (framework free vanilla JavaScript).
- No CSS external dependency.

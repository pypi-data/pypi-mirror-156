# Aleatora

Aleatora is a music composition framework, implemented as a Python library, built around the abstraction of lazy, effectful streams.

What does that mean? Like most audio synthesis frameworks, Aleatora lets you build up complex sounds by connecting generators in an audio graph (function composition + parallel composition). Unlike most, it also lets you build things up _horizontally_: streams can be composed sequentially, so the audio graph _change over time_ on its own (based on the computation described in the graph itself).

Additionally, streams may contain any kind of data type, not just samples. So you can use the same basic abstraction, and all the operations that it offers, to work with strings, events, arrays, MIDI data, etc., just as well as with individual audio samples.

## Installation

First, set up the environment:

    virtualenv venv -p python3  # or pypy3 for better performance
    source venv/bin/activate

Then, get the stable version of Aleatora:

    pip install aleatora  # for optional features, append a list like `[speech,foxdot]` (or `[all]`)

Or, get the latest version instead:

    pip install git+https://github.com/ijc8/aleatora.git

To ensure installation succeeded and that you can get sound out, try playing a sine tone:
```python
from aleatora import *
play(osc(440))
```

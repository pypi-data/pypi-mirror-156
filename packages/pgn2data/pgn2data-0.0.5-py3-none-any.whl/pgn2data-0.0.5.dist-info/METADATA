# pgn2data

This library converts chess pgn files into CSV tabulated data sets.

A pgn file can contain one or multiple chess games. The library parses the pgn file and creates two csv files:

- Games file: contains high level information (e.g. date, site, event, score, players etc...)

- Moves file: contains the moves for each game  (e.g. notation, squares, fen position, is in check etc...)

The two files can be mapped together using a GUID which the process inserts into both files.


## Installation

The library requires Python 3.7 or later.  
 
To install, type the following command on the python terminal:

    pip install pgn2data
    
  
## Implementation

Here is a basic example of how to convert a PGN file:

    from converter.pgn_data import PGNData
    
    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    result.print_summary()
    
The return value from the export function allows you to check whether the datasets have been created or not.

To group multiple files into the same output file you can do the following:

    pgn_data = PGNData(["file1.pgn","file2.pgn"],"output")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    result.print_summary()
    
The above code will process the two pgn files (file1 and file2) and export them to a file called "output.csv".


## Examples

The folder 'samples' in this repository, has some examples of the output from the library.

You can also go [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zq1200/magnus-carlsen-lichess-games-dataset) to see a Kaggle project that converted all of Magnus Carlsen's online Bullet games
into CSV format. 


## Columns

This is a full list of the columns in each output file:

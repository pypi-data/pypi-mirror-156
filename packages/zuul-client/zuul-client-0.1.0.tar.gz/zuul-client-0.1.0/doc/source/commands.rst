Privileged commands
-------------------

Some commands require a valid authentication token to be passed as the ``--auth-token``
argument. Administrators can generate such a token for users as needed.

Usage
-----
The general options that apply to all subcommands are:

Enqueue-ref
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: This command is only available with a valid authentication token.

.. program-output:: zuul-client enqueue-ref --help

This command is provided to manually simulate a trigger from an
external source.  It can be useful for testing or replaying a trigger
that is difficult or impossible to recreate at the source.  The
arguments to ``enqueue-ref`` will vary depending on the source and
type of trigger.  Some familiarity with the arguments emitted by
``gerrit`` `update hooks
<https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/projects/plugins/hooks>`__
such as ``patchset-created`` and ``ref-updated`` is recommended.  Some
examples of common operations are provided below.

Manual enqueue examples
***********************

It is common to have a ``release`` pipeline that listens for new tags
coming from ``gerrit`` and performs a range of code packaging jobs.
If there is an unexpected issue in the release jobs, the same tag can
not be recreated in ``gerrit`` and the user must either tag a new
release or request a manual re-triggering of the jobs.  To re-trigger
the jobs, pass the failed tag as the ``ref`` argument and set
``newrev`` to the change associated with the tag in the project
repository (i.e. what you see from ``git show X.Y.Z``)::

  zuul-client enqueue-ref --tenant openstack --trigger gerrit --pipeline release --project openstack/example_project --ref refs/tags/X.Y.Z --newrev abc123...

The command can also be used asynchronosly trigger a job in a
``periodic`` pipeline that would usually be run at a specific time by
the ``timer`` driver.  For example, the following command would
trigger the ``periodic`` jobs against the current ``master`` branch
top-of-tree for a project::

  zuul-client enqueue-ref --tenant openstack --trigger timer --pipeline periodic --project openstack/example_project --ref refs/heads/master

Another common pipeline is a ``post`` queue listening for ``gerrit``
merge results.  Triggering here is slightly more complicated as you
wish to recreate the full ``ref-updated`` event from ``gerrit``.  For
a new commit on ``master``, the gerrit ``ref-updated`` trigger
expresses "reset ``refs/heads/master`` for the project from ``oldrev``
to ``newrev``" (``newrev`` being the committed change).  Thus to
replay the event, you could ``git log`` in the project and take the
current ``HEAD`` and the prior change, then enqueue the event::

  NEW_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  OLD_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)

  zuul-client enqueue-ref --tenant openstack --trigger gerrit --pipeline post --project openstack/example_project --ref refs/heads/master --newrev $NEW_REF --oldrev $OLD_REF

Note that zero values for ``oldrev`` and ``newrev`` can indicate
branch creation and deletion; the source code of Zuul is the best reference
for these more advanced operations.


Promote
^^^^^^^

.. note:: This command is only available with a valid authentication token.

.. program-output:: zuul-client promote --help

This command will push the listed changes at the top of the chosen pipeline.

Example::

  zuul-client promote --tenant openstack --pipeline check --changes 12345,1 13336,3

Note that the format of changes id is <number>,<patchset>.

The promote action is used to reorder the change queue in a pipeline, by putting
the provided changes at the top of the queue; therefore this action makes the most
sense when performed against a dependent pipeline.

The most common use case for the promote action is the need to merge an urgent fix
when the gate pipeline has already several patches queued ahead. This is especially
needed if there is concern that one or more changes ahead in the queue may fail,
thus increasing the time to land for the fix; or concern that the fix may not
pass validation if applied on top of the current patch queue in the gate.

If the queue of a dependent pipeline is targeted by the promote, all the ongoing
jobs in that queue will be canceled and restarted on top of the promoted changes.

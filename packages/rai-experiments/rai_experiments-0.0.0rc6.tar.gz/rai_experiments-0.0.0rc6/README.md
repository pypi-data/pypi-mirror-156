This directory contains experiments and analyses that leverage the capabilities of the rai-toolbox.

Each entry in `experiments/` is an independent "project" that reproduces certain research results, or
that demonstrates particular features of the toolbox in an applied setting.

Before running any of these experiments, you need to install the `rai-experiments` package, which contains
various bespoke utilities that are required by the experiments. To install this, navigate to the `experiments/`
directory and run:

```shell
pip install .
```

Now you will be able to import from `rai_experiments` in your Python environment. You only need to perform
this one time for any given Python environment.

Some of the experiments contain Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files). In order to open and run these, you must [install
either jupyterlab or the "classic" jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).

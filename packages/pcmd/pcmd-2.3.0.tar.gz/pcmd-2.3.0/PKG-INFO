## About
During daily development, it can be frustrating,

- to type long commands when you start up the terminal for the day (or when your terminal shuts down due to unknown reasons!) or,
- to type a set of terminal commands repeatedly to do configuration, checks, and so on.

> For these problems...

***pcmd*** comes in handy :thumbsup:  
It's main features are

- It helps to execute commands with a user-define name. 
- It helps to execute multiple commands with just a single user-defined name.

A single config file ...

... and your ready to go !

Trust me, it is better than bash aliases!

# pyWoodway

### Parties Involved
Institution: Munroe Meyer Institute in the University of Nebraska Medical Center<br>
Laboratory: Virtual Reality Laboratory<br>
Advisor: Dr. James Gehringer<br>
Developer: Walker Arce<br>

### Motivation
This Python library was written to facilitate closed-loop experimental protocol for biomechanics and motor-control related research.

### Installation
Clone this repository, cd into the directory using either your virtual environment or your local environment, and run:
`python setup.py install`

### Usage
```
from pywoodway.treadmill import SplitBelt, find_treadmills
import time


a_sn = 'FTHCUWVAA'
b_sn = 'FTHCUQ9IA'
a_port, b_port = find_treadmills(a_sn=a_sn, b_sn=b_sn)

if a_port is not None and b_port is not None:
    print("Split belt treadmill found on ports", a_port, "and", b_port)
    sb = SplitBelt(a_port.name, b_port.name)
    sb.start_belts(True, False, True, False)
    print("Belt A set to 2 MPH and belt B set to -2 MPH.")
    sb.set_speed(2.0, -2.0)
    print("Set incline to 20%")
    sb.set_elevations(20.0)
    time.sleep(10)
    print("Split belt speed:", sb.get_speeds())
    print("Split belt incline:", sb.get_elevations())
    print("Belt A set to -2 MPH and belt B set to 2 MPH.")
    # sb.set_speed(-2.0, 2.0)
    time.sleep(10)
    print("Split belt speed:", sb.get_speeds())
    sb.stop_belts()
    print("Split belt is stopped.")
    sb.close()
else:
    print("Split belt treadmill was not found.")
```

To find your Woodway treadmill with the script, plug in your treadmill to your computer and execute the following script,

```
from serial.tools import list_ports

ports = list_ports.comports()
for port in ports:
    print(port.serial_number)
```

Write down the serial number for each treadmill (if using a split belt these are marked A and B) and pass those as arguments to the `find_treadmills()` function.

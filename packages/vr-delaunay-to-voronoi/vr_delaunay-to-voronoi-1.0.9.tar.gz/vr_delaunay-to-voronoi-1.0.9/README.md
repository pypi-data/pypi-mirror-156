# VR.Delaunay-To-Voronoi

Convert from Delaunay tesselation to Voronoi triangulation.
In contrast to qHull, this provides edges of Voronoi triangulations.

## Visualization

## Features

-   Largely typed
-   Reasonably quick
-   Fully tested

## Problem Statement

qHull provides edges, but not vertices of Voronoi triangulations.
To gather the edges and the vertices, this library derives them from the
  Delaunay tesselation.

## Approach

The Delaunay tesselation is calculated by qHull.
This provides a stable and known-good base to derive from.

# Iterative Query Selection (IQS)

## Check out the IQS algorithm web platform in the following link: [IQS Web](https://iqs.cs.bgu.ac.il/)

The platform can help you explore the IQS algorithm benefits:
* Search and retrieve data from Twitter's website using the IQS algorithm.
* Displays results from the experiment described in the academic paper. In the experiment, the IQS algorithm is compared to another algorithm in the field (ALMIK) on a specific dataset.
* Presenting the academic paper with Q&A

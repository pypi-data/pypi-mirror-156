# Changelog

This file contains the changes made between released versions.

The format is based on [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the versioning tries to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## 0.8.0
### Fixed
- The `shell` command is now executed in a shell (shock.gif) and will expand things like `*.md` correctly
- Keybindings that start with `::` will now expand the `%` placeholders (like `%f` or `%p`)

### Added
- `files.show-hidden-files` configuration option
- `files.show-sidecar-files` configuration option
- `editor.no-completion` configuration option to prevent completion for some tags
- `editor.tags` configuration option to suggest standard extra tags
- Introduced `paste-overwrite` and `paste-append` in the file browser
- `launch` command (in file browser)
- Blocking processes (e.g. long copy operations) can be cancelled by pressing `Esc` or `^C` (at least you can request it; the file browser will try to listen to it)

### Changed
- The regular `paste` in the file browser will no longer paste with a new file name when a file with the same name already exists. Instead you will see an error message. See `paste-append` and `paste-overwrite` in the documentation.


## 0.7.0
### Added
- Help panel added. Try `F1`, `?`, or `:help` to show all shortcuts and available commands

- `all.find-case-sensitive` configuration option
- `open-with` command
- `files.selection-icon` configuration option (what symbol to use to indicate a selected file or folder)
- `files.info` configuration option (extra info columns, like file size)
- Completion box for extra metadata values in the editor panel

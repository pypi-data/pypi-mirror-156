.SS Blocking operations
.sp
When there’s a blocking operation on\-going (like copying a lot of files,
big files, or from mounted network drives), a blocking window will show the
progress of the operation.
.sp
You can request that the operation be cancelled by pressing \fBEscape\fP or
\fB^C\fP\&. Metaindexmanager will do its best to cancel the running operations
in a safe manner, but will not roll back any changes that have occurred
already.
.SH FILES
.sp
The configuration file of metaindexmanager is by default expected at
\fB~/.config/metaindexmanager/config.rc\fP and consists of one command per
line (usually \fBbind\fP and \fBset\fP commands, see \fI\%Commands\fP below).
Empty or commented lines (starting with a \fB#\fP) are ignored.
.sp
Python files in \fB~/.local/share/metaindexmanager/addons/\fP are considered
addons and will be loaded upon startup. See \fI\%Addons\fP below for details.
.sp
metaindexmanager will create a logfile to report unexpected or erroneous
behaviour. The location of that logfile can be manually configured by
providing the \fB\-\-log\-file\fP parameter upon startup. The default location
is \fB~/.local/share/metaindexmanager/ui.log\fP\&.
.SH SELECT FILE MODE
.sp
You can run metaindexmanager in \fB\-\-select\-file\-mode\fP to use it as an
\(dqopen file dialog\(dq in various applications, like (neo)mutt.
.sp
When running in select file mode, the \fB<Return>\fP key will be used to
select the current file, exit the program and write the full path to the
selected file into \fB\-\-select\-file\-output\fP (by default the standard
output).
.sp
To select any indexed text file or something from your home folder you
could run this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
metaindexmanager \-\-select\-file\-mode \(dqmimetype:plain/text\(dq \(dq~\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In actual use cases, you will likely have to write the result to a file
with the \fB\-\-select\-file\-output=file\fP parameter.
.SS Example use case: (neo)mutt
.sp
If you wanted to use this in (neo)mutt to select email attachments, you
could use the script file \fBmtattach.sh\fP (in \fBextras\fP) and set
it up in mutt with this macro:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# example (neo)mutt configuration to use \(aqa\(aq in the mail composition
# screen to attach a file using metaindexmanager select file mode
macro  compose  a  \(dq<shell\-escape>mtattach.sh<return><enter\-command>source /run/user/\(gaid \-u\(ga/mtattach.rc<return><shell\-escape>rm /run/user/\(gaid \-u\(ga/mtattach.rc<return>\(dq \(dqAttach file\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBmtattach.sh\fP script launches metaindexmanager with the
\fB\-\-select\-file\-\-mode\fP and writes the selected file name into
\fB/run/user/\(gaid \-u\(ga/mtattach.rc\fP\&. (neo)mutt will then read that file as a
command to execute the attaching.
.SH ADDONS
.sp
\fBBeware\fP that addons are just python files. They can in theory do
anything on your computer with your permissions. If you install a malicious
addon, it could upload all your files to the internet and/or encrypt all
your files and ask you for ransom.
.sp
\fBNever install addons from untrusted sources!\fP
.SS Installing
.sp
To install an addon, copy the corresponding \fB\&.py\fP file or the module
folder (the one containing the \fB__init__.py\fP file) into your addons
folder (usually at \fB~/.local/share/metaindexmanager/addons/\fP).
.SS Writing your own
.sp
Currently there are three possible types of addons:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
panels, extending \fBmetaindexmanager.panel.ListPanel\fP or using the
\fBmetaindexmanager.panel.register\fP decorator,
.IP \(bu 2
commands, extending \fBmetaindexmanager.command.Command\fP,
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Be sure to add the \fB@registered_command\fP, \fB@registered_layout\fP, or
\fB@register_humanizer\fP decorators to your classes or functions.
.sp
Have a look at the layouts in \fBmetaindexmanager.layouts\fP and the commands
in \fBmetaindexmanager.commands\fP to understand how commands work.
\fBmetaindexmanager.docpanel\fP and \fBmetaindexmanager.filepanel\fP also have
a bunch of commands defined that are restricted to these panels.
.sp
At the end of \fBmetaindexmanager.humanize\fP you can find a few examples of
how to write tag value formatters.
.sp
The use of the \fBmetaindexmanager.panel.register\fP decorator allows you to
create a new type of panel for use in bookmarks and as an option for
\fBall.default\-panel\fP\&. The constructor of your panel type must accept these
parameters in order: \fBapplication\fP and \fBlocation\fP\&. \fBapplication\fP is
needed anyway for the underlying \fBcursedspace.Panel\fP\&. \fBlocation\fP might
be \fBNone\fP or missing and you should be able to create the panel anyway.
.sp
If you add a new panel, make sure there is also a command to open that panel
one way or the other.
.SS Examples
.sp
Here is an example of a humanizer to transform the value for XMP\(aqs
\fBorientation\fP tag into a human\-readable value:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from metaindexmanager import humanize

@humanize.register_humanizer(\(aqXmp.tiff.orientation\(aq)
def format_tiff_orientation(value):
    mapping = {
        \(aq1\(aq: \(aqHorizontal\(aq,
        \(aq2\(aq: \(aqMirrore horizontal\(aq,
        \(aq3\(aq: \(aqRotate by 180°\(aq,
        \(aq4\(aq: \(aqMirror vertical\(aq,
        \(aq5\(aq: \(aqMirror horizontal and rotate 270° CW\(aq,
        \(aq6\(aq: \(aqRotate 90° CW\(aq,
        \(aq7\(aq: \(aqMirror horizontal and rotate 90° CW\(aq,
        \(aq8\(aq: \(aqRotate 270° CW\(aq
    }

    return mapping.get(str(value))

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.sp
Configuration options can be set using the \fBset\fP command. Either during
runtime from the command line or in the configuration file.
.sp
The following options exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBall.editor\fP
What text editor to use when a text editor should be launched from
within metaindexmanager.
.TP
.B \fBall.opener\fP
What program to use to open files for viewing in an external program.
.sp
A good program to use is \fBrifle\fP of the ranger file manager.
.sp
The default is \fBxdg\-open\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBall.history\-size\fP
How many entries should be remembered in the command history.
.sp
Defaults to \fB1000\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBall.border\fP
How much space should be wasted on drawing borders. Can be set to
either \fBfull\fP or \fBminimal\fP\&.
.sp
Defaults to \fBfull\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBall.info\-timeout\fP
How long should errors or info messages be displayed at the bottom of
the screen. A duration of 4 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes, and 1 second
would be written like this: \fB4d3h2m1s\fP\&.
.sp
Defaults to \fB10s\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBall.default\-panel\fP
What panel type should be opened by default when starting
\fImetaindexmanager\fP and no location has been specified?
.sp
Possible values are \fBfiles\fP, and \fBdocuments\fP\&.
Addons might add to the list of possible values, please refer to the
documentation of these addons.
.sp
Defaults to \fBdocuments\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBall.find\-case\-sensitive\fP
Whether or not the \fBfind\fP command should work case sensitive.
.sp
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBfiles.use\-icons\fP
Set this to \fByes\fP (or \fB1\fP, \fBy\fP, \fBon\fP) to use icons in the
file and folder listing. That means that the shell variables
\fBUSERDIR_ICONS\fP and \fBLS_ICONS\fP will be used to find out what icon
to show per entry.
.sp
The format of \fBLS_ICONS\fP and \fBUSERDIR_ICONS\fP is based on
\fBLS_COLORS\fP: a \fB:\fP separated list of filetype/folder names assigned
to font awesome/nerdfont icons (the following examples will look broken
if you don’t have font awesome or nerdfont installed).
For example, if you want to use a special icon for your downloads and
music folders, you could set your \fBUSERDIR_ICONS\fP variable to
\fBdownloads=:music=\fP\&.
Similarly, to show all normal files as \fBf\fP, folders as \fBF\fP and only
JPEG files as \fB\fP, you could set your \fBLS_ICONS\fP variable to
\fBfi=f:di=F:*.jpeg=:*.jpg=\fP\&.
.sp
metaindexmanager has some defaults built\-in.
.TP
.B \fBfiles.selection\-icon\fP
What text symbol (or icon) to use to indicate selected files or
folders. The default is a blank space, but you could also use a
checkmark (\fB✔\fP).
.TP
.B \fBfiles.info\fP
What extra information columns to show on the right side. Separate the
options with a comma. Possible options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBnum_rights\fP or \fBoctmode\fP, the access rights as octal number
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlm_abs\fP, absolute date and time when the file was last modified
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlm_duration\fP, how long ago this file was last modified
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBfiles.show\-hidden\-files\fP
Whether or not to show hidden files. There\(aqs also a convenient command
\fBtoggle\-hidden\fP to toggle the display per panel instead of
program\-wide.
.sp
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBfiles.show\-sidecar\-files\fP
Whether or not to show sidecar files. There\(aqs also a convenient command
\fBtoggle\-sidecar\fP to toggle the display per panel instead of
program\-wide.
.sp
Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdocuments.columns\fP
Defines the default columns for any new documents panel.
.sp
Columns are metadata tag names, like \fBextra.title\fP or \fBmimetype\fP\&.
You may also use synonyms (\fBauthor\fP instead of only
\fBextra.author\fP).
To show more than just the first value (in case a document has multiple
values for one metadata tag), you can add a \fB+\fP after the tag name.
.sp
The special column \fBicon\fP is not a metadata tag, but instead shows an
icon (see \fBfiles.use\-icons\fP option above) based on the file type.
.sp
The default is \fBtitle filename tags+ mimetype\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBeditor.multiline\-indicator\fP
What single character to show when a metadata tag has line breaks.
.sp
Defaults to \fB…\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBeditor.cutoff\-indicator\fP

shown with the screen size.
.sp
Defaults to \fB→\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBeditor.no\-completion\fP
Comma separated list of \fBextra\fP tags that should not show any
completion.
.sp
Defaults to \fBtitle\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBeditor.tags\fP
Comma separated list of \fBextra\fP tags that should be shown as
suggestions in the \fBadd\-tag\fP command.
.sp
If you want to also see all other \fBextra\fP tags that have been set up
before, add the \fB*\fP value to the list, too.
.sp
Defaults to \fB*, contributor, coverage, creator, date, description,
format, identifier, language, publisher, relation, rights, source,
subject, title, type\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdictionary.<tag>\fP
The \fBdictionary\fP namespace of configuration options can be used by
you to define the allowed (or suggested) words for \fBextra.\fP metadata
values.
.sp
For example, if you set the \fBdictionary.location\fP to the values
\fBhome, work, cabin\fP you will see a completion suggesting these values
when you add or edit a \fBlocation\fP tag using the editor panel.
.sp
If you want to allow all existing values of a given tag, and a few
suggestions, you can add the special value \fB*\fP, like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set dictionary.rating \(dqgood, bad, ugly, *\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example if you had rated some file as \fBmeh\fP, this value would
also show in the completion when you add or edit a \fBrating\fP tag using
the editor panel.
.sp
If you don\(aqt define a dictionary for a tag, metaindexmanager will
always show the existing values as suggestions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
Commands can be bound to shortcuts or entered directly in the command line.
The command to open the command line is called \fBenter\-command\fP and
usually bound to \fB:\fP\&.
.sp
Based on what panel is currently in focus (file browser, document browser,
editor, etc.) different commands may be available.
The autocompletion in the command line should be aware of that and provide
only valid suggestions.
.sp
Some commands accept or even require additional parameters that can be
given on the commandline, but are a bit more tricky when bound to
shortcuts. See details for that below in the \fBbind\fP command.
.sp
Here is a list of all commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBclose\fP

metaindexmanager will end.
.TP
.B \fBquit\fP
Quit metaindexmanager.
.TP
.B \fBnext\-panel\fP
Focus the next panel.
.TP
.B \fBprevious\-panel\fP
Focus the previous panel.
.TP
.B \fBfocus\fP
Focus the given panel. If called with a parameter, e.g. \fBfocus 2\fP, it
will focus panel with label \fB2\fP\&. If called without a parameter, it
will ask the user for the panel to focus on.
.TP
.B \fBnew\-file\-panel\fP
Open a new file browser panel.
.TP
.B \fBnew\-documents\-panel\fP
Open a new document browser panel.
.TP
.B \fBenter\-command\fP

.TP
.B \fBcancel\-command\fP
Close the command line and return focus to the previous panel.
.TP
.B \fBrepaint\fP
Enforce a repaint of the screen.
.TP
.B \fBlayout\fP
Change the layout of the panels. Provide the name of the layout you
want to use as the first parameter. If you don\(aqt give a parameter, the
available layouts will be listed for you.
.TP
.B \fBsource\fP
Load the configuration file given in the first parameter to this
command. Usually only used from your configuration file.
.TP
.B \fBbind\fP
Bind a command to a shortcut. Expects three parameters: scope, key(s),
and command.
.sp
The scope is either \fBany\fP (meaning any panel; file browser, document
browser, metadata editor, etc.) or either of \fBdocuments\fP (a document
browser panel), \fBfiles\fP (a file browser panel), \fBeditor\fP (a
metadata editor panel).
.sp
Keys can be single keys, like \fBc\fP or \fBC\fP (to indicate the use of
the shift key), \fB^H\fP (to indicate the use of a control key), or
special key names like \fB<return>\fP or \fB<escape>\fP\&.
Keys can also be sequences of keys, like \fBgTx<backspace>^Y\fP to
indicate the the user must do this magic dance on the keyboard in
sequence to call the bound command.
.sp
Commands can be given in three different ways. The basic case is to
just give a command name, like \fBenter\-command\fP\&. This command does not
expect any parameters, to nothing more is required.
If a command expects parameters, you can provide them right in this
parameter, but you must prefix the command with \fB::\fP, for example to
bind a shortcut to switch to the tabbed layout, you could write \fBbind
any LT \(dq::layout tabbed\(dq\fP\&.
The third possibility is to only open the command line, type the first
part of the command and let the user input the rest, like this: \fBbind
any L? :layout\fP\&.
.sp
An optional last parameter may be used to give a command a nice help
text.
.TP
.B \fBset\fP
Set a configuration option. Expects two parameters: configuration
option name and value. If only the configuration name is given, the
current value is shown.
The configuration option name is \fBscope.name\fP, with scope either
being \fBall\fP (meaning, generic application level configuration) or
either of the panel scopes (\fBdocuments\fP, \fBfiles\fP, \fBeditor\fP,
etc.).
.sp
Example: \fBset all.opener xdg\-open\fP
.sp
For available configuration options, see above in \fI\%Configuration options\fP
.TP
.B \fBfind\fP
Find the entry that matches what you are trying to find.
.sp
Example: if you are in the file panel and want to find the next text
file in the listing, you could type \fB:find .txt\fP
.TP
.B \fBfind\-next\fP
Find the next entry that matches the previous \fBfind\fP command.
.sp
Example: if you tried to \fB:find .txt\fP before and now execute
\fBfind\-next\fP, it will repeat the \fBfind\fP command and find the next
entry that matches \fB\&.txt\fP\&.
.TP

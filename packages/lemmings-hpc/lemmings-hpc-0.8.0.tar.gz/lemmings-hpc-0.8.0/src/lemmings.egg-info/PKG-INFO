Description: # LEMMINGS
        
        ## Introducing Lemmings
        
        Lemmings (lemmings-hpc) is an open-source code designed to simplify job scheduling on HPC clusters. It achieves this goal by offering the user a set of functionalities that does not require a priori knowledge on how to interact with a job sheduler. The emphasize can then be  placed on the workflow management. Portability of these workflows between different machines and machine environments will be ensured through lemmings.
        
        
        **Two aspects** have to be clearly **distinguished** within lemmings:
        
        - The interaction with the job sheduler 
          - this part is taken care of **by lemmings**
          - requires basic information from the user about the environment (see *Machine* section below)
        - The workflow
          - this part is taken care of **by the user**: lemmings needs to know what to do
          - lemmings offers a framework in which this **has to be** **defined** (see *Workflow* section below)
        
        
        
        The usage of lemmings can be extremely versatile with some examples
        
        - chained runs
        - chained runs with intermediate mesh refinements
        - chained runs with changes of settings based on intermediate (postprocessed) solutions
        - chained runs with conditional evolution
        - ...
        
        While originally developed within the context of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications, in its construction, lemmings is not limited to this.
        
        
        ***To avoid infinite loops lemmings requires the user to specify a maximum allowed CPU hours to be consumed.***
        
        
        **Note: The use of lemmings can best be understood in conjunction with the provided examples in the `/example/` directory on the associated repository `https://gitlab.com/cerfacs/lemmings`. Note as well that individual workflows might require additional python and / or non-python packages to be installed.**
        
        
        ## Install Lemmings
        
        Lemmings is open-source and can be pip-installed :
        
        ```bash
        pip install lemmings-hpc
        ```
        
        We highly recommend to consider using a virtual environment.
        
        In case you whish to install lemmings and its dependencies through wheels just follow the procedure under the section [How can I install something on an machine without internet?](https://cerfacs.fr/coop/python-faq).
        
        ## Machine
        Lemmings requires basic information of the environment (job scheduler) it's being used in: "Lemmings needs to know how to interact with the job scheduler." This is specified in the form of a `{machine}.yml` file which we will simply call `machine.yml`.  After its definition, for lemmings to access this information an environment variable  `LEMMINGS_MACHINE`  must be defined and can be done with the following command:
        
        ```bash
        export LEMMINGS_MACHINE='absolute_path_to_your_machine.yml'
        ```
        **In order to ensure that the `$LEMMINGS_MACHINE` environment variable exist at every session we advice to add the above command to your `.bashrc` file.**
        
        Once defined, **the machine.yml file can be changed at any moment**. The only thing that has to be fixed at least once is the above environment variable.  The `machine.yml` file can be edited, for instance, as follow:
        
        ```bash
         vim $LEMMINGS_MACHINE
        ```
        
        Examples of `machine.yml`  files can be found in `lemmings/src/lemmings/chain/machine_template/` which could already be suitable for your environment.  If it's not the case, no worries, you can easily create your own. **It is adviced to locate your machine.yml file somewhere outside of lemmings.**
        
        ### Create your Machine configuration {machine}.yml
        
        A `machine.yml ` file, as shown below, contains two main groups 
        
        ```yaml
        commands:
          submit: sbatch
          cancel: scancel
          get_cpu_time: sacct -j -LEMMING-JOBID- --format=Elapsed -n
          dependency: "--dependency=afterany:"
        queues:
          debug:      #--> user defined name
            wall_time: '00:20:00'
            # core_nb is a parameter REQUIRED BY LEMMINGS in order to correctly
            # compute the elapsed CPU time during the chain
            core_nb: 24    # core_nb = nodes*ntaks-per-node !!!
            header: |
                    #!/bin/bash
                    #SBATCH --partition debug
                    #SBATCH --nodes=1
                    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
                    #SBATCH --job-name -LEMMING-JOB_NAME-
                    #SBATCH --time=-LEMMING-WALL-TIME-
          
                    -EXEC-
          debug_pj:   #--> user defined name
            wall_time: '00:02:00'
            header: |
                   	#!/bin/bash
                    #SBATCH --partition debug
                    #SBATCH --nodes=1
                    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
                    #SBATCH --job-name -LEMMING-POSTJOB_NAME-
                    #SBATCH --time=-LEMMING-WALL-TIME-
        
                    -EXEC_PJ-
        ```
        - commands: 
        
          - groups a basic set of commands to interact with the job sheduler
          - has to be defined only once per machine you plan to run on
        
        - queues:
        
          - Groups information on the queues that the user whishes to use **and** exist on the cluster:
            - It is basically a list of aliases containing information on partitions to run on and how many resources we want to use.
            - In the above example we have a `debug` and a `debug_pj` queue which are both using the "debug" partition but different wall times and resources.
          - The commands to request the resources are introduced through the `header` and  dependent on the type of machine environment.
          - The **wall_time** parameter is the wall clock time limit of the machine queue. It could be in **HH:MM:SS** format or a **Float** in seconds. 
        
          - The **core\_nb** parameter represents the number of cores a given queue will use. **This is a parameter REQUIRED BY LEMMINGS in order to CORRECTLY compute the elapsed CPUh cost**.
          Be careful, sometimes in the batch (`header` part) you use directly **core_nb**, sometimes you have to use "node number" * "ntasks-per-node". In any case, the core number will **ONLY** be taken via the  **core_nb** parameter and **NEVER** in the BATCH parameters.
        
          - The `machine.yml` requires at least two queues : `job` and `post job` (or pjob). This is simply a consequence of the working strategy of lemmings.  A `job`  queue is indicated by the  `-EXEC-` keyword at the end of the header whereas `-EXEC_PJ-`  indicates a  `pjob` queue. These two strings will be replaced by the associated executable information specified in the `workflow.yml` file as exemplified below. 
        
            ```yaml
            # associated with -EXEC-
            exec: |
                  source "path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate"
                  module load avbp
                  mpirun -np $SLURM_NPROCS path/to/exec
            # associated with -EXEC_PJ-
            exec_pj: |
                  source "path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate"
            ```
        
        The user can define as many queues as wished (with the required information), e.g. a queue called *prod_long* which has a wall_time of 24h, a *prod_short* with wall_time of 5h, etc., as longs as the value does not exceed the maximum limit set by the machine on the specific partition. Moreover, multiple queues can be associated with the same partition.  *The `machine.yml` should  be seen as a list of options, or better, option pairs given the job / pjob link, from which the user can select in the workflow definition.*
        
        
        
        ## Workflow
        
        ***Lemmings is the base that permits the execution of workflows but all the mecanisms of lemmings are independant of the workflow used.  Indeed, workflows are customizable whereas lemmings is not.***
        
        The workflow is **what the user would like to achieve through lemmings**, be it a simple chained run, a chained run with mesh refinement or whatever floats your boat.  Nevertheless, the workflow has to **follow the lemmings rules.**
        
        A Workflow configures the scheme your run will follow, from a simple recursivity, to a mesh adaptation, a postprocessing operation, or customized operations. A Workflow is set up by two files :
        
        - `{workflow_name}.py` : Python script of the scheme.
        - `{workflow_name}.yml` : Yaml registering specific properties of your run' Workflow. **It is adviced to locate it in your run directory.** It can be located somewhere else in which case its path has to be specified (see `lemmings run --help`).
        
        
        <!-- You can find available Workflows defined in python scripts  in `lemmings/src/lemmings/chain/workflows` along with yaml examples or in the ` example/barbatruc` folder.  If the Workflow you need is not available, it can be defined as described further below. -->
        
        
        In a similar way to the  Machine setup, an environment variable, `LEMMINGS_WORKFLOW` , can be defined to locate existing Workflows:
        
        ```bash
        export LEMMINGS_WORKFLOW=/absolute_path_to_workflows_folder/
        ```
        <!-- The following command shows the different Workflows available in the `LEMMINGS_WORKFLOW ` associated folder :
        
        ```bash
        lemmings info workflows
        ```
        You can display informations on a specific Workflow stored in the  `LEMMINGS_WORKFLOW ` folder :
        
        ```bash
        lemmings info {workflow_name}
        ​``` -->
        
        Note: 
        - unlike the definition of a Machine environment variable, the workflow related environment variable is not a requirement, in which case the `{workflow_name}.py`  file should be located in the run folder. It is however adviced to centralise workflows instead of  resorting to endless copy - pasting when running from different folders. 
        - be careful in the naming: if a workflow has the same `{workflow_name}.py`  name in both the local directory and in the  `$LEMMINS_WORKFLOW` location , the local workflow will be prioritized.
        
        
        ### Create your Workflow 
        
        **NOTE: the workflow configuration file (.yml) and  script (.py) MUST have the same prefix!!!**
        
        #### The configuration {workflow_name}.yml
        
        Every workflow requires a configuration file. This file will be completed by the end user of lemmings. The number of parameters/informations required is workflow dependent, so make sure you know them or contact your 'garant'. 
        
        <!-- You can create a default configuration file (*if the workflow permits it*) using the command: 
        
        ​```bash
        lemmings init {workflow_name}
        ​``` -->
        
        There are 5 mandatory parameters that have to be present in each configuration file:
        
        - **exec** : Here, write what you want to put in your Batch file instead of the "-EXEC-" string  from the {machine}.yml. 
        <!-- You can use the `lemmings info machine` command to understand the construction of the Batch file. -->
        
        - **exec_pj**: the same as `exec` but for the post-job queue. You may just need to source your virtual environment to execute lemmings post-job
        
        - **job\_queue/pjob\_queue**: The name of the queue you want to use for the Job/Post-job of lemmings. Queues are listed in the {machine}.yml configuration file. 
        <!-- You can use the `lemmings info machine` command to see it. -->
        - **cpu_limit** : The maximum CPU [hours] that the lemmings chain can use.
        
        The next one is not mandatory but can be used by lemmings:
        
        - **job_prefix**: Lemmings auto generates a chain name and directory with the template : CVCVNN (e.g. JAZE53). If this parameter is present, a prefix will be added before the auto generated chain name (e.g. myprefix_JAZE53). **The logfile (.log) associated with your run will be located in here upon completion.**
        
        
        <!-- - **percentage_of\_tgt**: Percentage of the target dtsum that is acceptable to stop lemmings. For exemple, if "simulation\_end\_time"=0.10s and the "percentage\_of\_tgt"=10 [%], if at the end of the loop the "dtsum"= 0.09 lemmings stops and considers the condition\_tgt to be reached. **This parameter was added to avoid a complete run to be restarted if we're very close to our final target time in which case continuing a run might end up with a large waste of computational resources.** 
        
        - **solution\_writing_time**: Time to substract from the queue wall time. It corresponds to the desired writing time. For example, if your *wall\_clock\_time* is 12:00:00 and *solution_writing\_time*=00:30:00, simulation will stop at 11:30:00. If this key is not present, **by default the *solution_writing_time* is 00:15:00.**  -->
        
        #### The script  {workflow_name}.py
        
        The workflow is defined through a class called *LemmingJob* and sets the framework that must be followed by the user.  The structure is represented below and contains
        - 7 methods:
          - a set of python functions in which the user can define actions
          - interaction with the sheduler is initiated after "Prepare run" 
        - 1 database.yml:
          - a database file which contains information for lemmings
          - can be accessed by each method (see examples and docs for more information)
          - the user can also add information about the run or information to be shared between the methods

                                |                                           |        :

        For an actual example of a `workflow.py` definition, please refer to the `example/barbatruc`  directory. The docs do also provide the user with further information on its definition and strict structure. 
        
        
        ## Launch lemmings
        
        In your RUN directory, you **need**   the {workflow_name}.yml file.  When it is correctly filled, launch Lemmings from your RUN directory  with: 
        
        ```
        lemmings run {workflow_name}
        ```
        You can cancel a Lemmings run if necessary, from within the directory lemmings was launched with:
        
        ```
        lemmings kill
        ```
        
        ## More lemmings features
        Lemmings offers additional features. Have a look at the docs for further details.
        
        ### A restart mode
        Normally, every time the `lemmings run {workflow}` command is invoked, a new chain is instantiated. If the previous `database.yml` file is still present, it will contain the previous chain and the new one. The "restart" mode will instead continue on the latest pre-existing chain inside the `database.yml` file. It can be called with  
        ```bash 
        lemmings run {workflow} --restart
        ````
        Note that the elapsed CPUh will be reset to 0 at each restart. In se, the "restart" mode can be seen as a new chain appended to the latest one.
        
        ### A farming mode
        The "farming" mode allows the user to run simultaneously multiple lemmings chains. It is ideally suited for parametric studies. The user needs to take care of the change in parameters in the workflow. The "farming" mode can be launched with the command
        
        ```bash
        lemmings-farming run {workflow_name}
        or 
        lemmings-farming run {workflow_name}
        ```
        
        Additional settings are required in the {worfklow}.yml file. More info is provided in the documentation: how to, tutorials and explanation.

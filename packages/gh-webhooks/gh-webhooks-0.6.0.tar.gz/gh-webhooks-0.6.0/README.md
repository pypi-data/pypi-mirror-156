# Typed event handling for GitHub Webhooks

This library provides types for using GitHub Webhook events in Python, and a class for registering event handlers for each event type.

An example using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from gh_webhooks import GhWebhookEventHandler
from gh_webhooks.types import BranchProtectionRuleCreated

app = FastAPI()
event_handler = GhWebhookEventHandler()

@event_handler.on(BranchProtectionRuleCreated)
async def handle_new_branch_protection_rule(event: BranchProtectionRuleCreated):
    print(event.repository.name)


@app.post("/payload")
async def handle_webhook_payload(request: Request):
    event = await request.json()
    await event_handler.handle_event(event)
```

You can also see a basic example project [here](https://github.com/k2bd/gh-webhooks-test).

Multiple handlers can be registered to the same event type, and they'll run concurrently.

The types are auto-generated using [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator).
A GitHub action maintains these types automatically.

Integration tests are also auto-generated from the [example events](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks/tree/master/payload-examples) in the GitHub Webhook events spec docs.

## Developing

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and `poetry install` the project

### Useful Commands

Note: if Poetry is managing a virtual environment for you, you may need to use `poetry run poe` instead of `poe`

- `poe autoformat` - Autoformat code
- `poe lint` - Lint code
- `poe test` - Run tests
- `poe docs` - Build docs
- `poe codegen` - Generate types

### Release

Release a new version by manually running the release action on GitHub with a 'major', 'minor', or 'patch' version bump selected.
This will create and push a new semver tag of the format `v1.2.3`, which in turn will trigger an action to automatically publish a new version to PyPI.

Optionally create a release from this new tag to let users know what changed.

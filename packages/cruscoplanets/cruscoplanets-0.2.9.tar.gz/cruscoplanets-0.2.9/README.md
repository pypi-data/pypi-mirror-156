# cruscoplanets

Graphic editor for Morpurgo's dialectic astrology

## Summary

Cruscoplanets is a tool for elaborating astrological charts according to the perspective of Morpurgo's astrological school. Consequently, according to Morpurgo's positions, it is a minimal software, which is able to create exclusively birth and transit charts, and does not consider asteroids or astrological points. On the other hand, in addition to the common ten astrological planets, it considers in also Eris' ephemeris, in accordance with the recent, and more and more confirmed, hypothesis that Eris corresponds to Morpugo's X planet. If in the future also Y is individuated, it will be added in the software as well.

## Usage

Though cruscoplanets has been fundamentally structured as a package, it provides also some injection points. Once installed the package in your environment, you can type on your terminal ``cruscoplanets --help`` for displaying a list of operations that you can do in command line. In particular, you can:

 - create a birth chart in svg, png or jpeg format;
 - create a transit chart in svg, png or jpeg format;
 - browse the locations database (and getting the location's id, which is necessary for the operations above)
 - get and set a default location

For creating an astrological chart with cruscoplanets you must now introduce in input the relative date(s) and time(s) in the cruscoplanets format. Please refer to the documentation in order to see how it works.

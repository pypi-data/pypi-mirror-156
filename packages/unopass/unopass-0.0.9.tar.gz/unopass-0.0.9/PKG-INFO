# unopass

##### Written by [Amado Tejada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amadotejada/)


### What is unopass?

To move away from using secrets in env variables, or conf files, I needed a simple python solution for macOS to retrieve 1Password secrets via biometrics and use them in my local python code.Â I tried several solutions from 1Password and 3rdparty, but were lacking or overkill for my use case.

*unopass* is a simple to use [1Password CLI](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/) python module that allows you to retrieve secrets using your biometrics (via Touch ID) in scripts.

Note: *unopass* is early alpha software and is not supported by 1Password.

#### Requirements:
 * [ 1Password CLI ](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started#install) v2.4.1 or higher
 * [ 1Password Mac App ](https://1password.com/mac/) v8.7.1 or higher
 *  [Biometrics](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started#turn-on-biometric-unlock) (Touch ID) enabled
 * macOS 12.4 or higher

### Security
Authorization expires after 10 minutes of inactivity in the session. There's a hard limit of 12 hours, after which you must reauthorize.

Learn about 1Password Biometrics Security [here](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/biometric-security)

### Install

Pypi:
```bash
pip3 install unopass
```

You can also import *unopass* from source.

### How to use?
Once the requirements are met, use *unopass* following the example below:

```python
from unopass import unopass as secret


"""
secret.unopass({VAULT}, {ITEM}, {FIELD})

OPTIONAL: signout of the 1Password CLI session:
    call signout() with deauthorize=True to signout of the 1Password session
"""

username = secret.unopass("work", "server", "username")
password = secret.unopass("work", "server", "password")

secret.signout(deauthorize=True)


print(f"user: {username}\npass: {password}")
```

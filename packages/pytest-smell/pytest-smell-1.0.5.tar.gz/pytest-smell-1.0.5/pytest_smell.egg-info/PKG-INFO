```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
pytest-smell

pytest-smell --verbose

# Specifying tests directory (if there is one dedicated) for optimization
pytest-smell --tests_path=path_to_tests

# Specifying output path for exporting results as a CSV file
pytest-smell --out_path=path_to_desired_directory

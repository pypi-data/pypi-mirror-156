__doc__ = """
``keyszer`` is a smart and flexible key remapper for Linux/X11t.
It's like ``xmodmap`` but better.

-  Has high-level and flexible remapping mechanisms, such as

   -  **per-application keybindings can be defined**
   -  **multiple stroke keybindings can be defined** such as
      ``Ctrl+x Ctrl+c`` to ``Ctrl+q``

-  Runs in low-level layer (``evdev`` and ``uinput``), making
   **remapping work in almost all the places**

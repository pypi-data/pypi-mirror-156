The Sharing Configs Library was created by Maykin Media in conjunction with the 
Sharing Configs API, to share configurations between organizations.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made the components that 
much better:

    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Tatjana Rietveldt <tatjana@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The Demodam initiative where this concept won a prize that kicked off the
    development.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.

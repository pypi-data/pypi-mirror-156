## Typing stubs for gdb

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `gdb` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `gdb`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/gdb. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Type hints for GDB's [Python API](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html). Note that this API is available only when running Python scripts under GDB: is is not possible to install the `gdb` package separately, for instance using `pip`.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `6a5abd38cf9b08424779647617f836eb9252ea26`.

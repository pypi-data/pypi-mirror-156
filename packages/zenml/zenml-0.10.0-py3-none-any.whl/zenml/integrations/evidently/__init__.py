"""Initialization of the Evidently integration.

The Evidently integration provides a way to monitor your models in production.
It includes a way to detect data drift and different kinds of model performance
issues.

The results of Evidently calculations can either be exported as an interactive
dashboard (visualized as an html file or in your Jupyter notebook), or as a JSON
file.

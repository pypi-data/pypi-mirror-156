# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.2] - 2022-06-28

### Fixed

- When sample_weights are used to fit models then `feyn.Model.loss_value` computes the weighted mean loss. That means that weighted mean loss is used again for sorting models when `sample_weights` argument is passed to `feyn.fit_models()` or `feyn.QLattice.auto_run()`.

## [3.0.1] - 2022-04-27

### Changed

- Use of `feyn` is now fully local, using an improved and lightweight version of the `QLattice` bundled within `feyn`.
- You should now use `feyn.QLattice()` to get a `QLattice`. Notice that the previous functions `feyn.connect_qlattice()` and `ql.reset()` are now deprecated. They have been updated to match the new workflow to ensure previous code still works as intended, but will be removed in future releases of `feyn`.

### Fixed

- `plot_response_1d` on a single-feature model no longer requires the `by` argument.
- `plot_activation_flow` now warns the user when more than one sample is given.
- Updated outdated LICENSE file

## [2.1.5] - 2022-03-25

### Changed

- `sklearn` and `sympy` is now a dependency of `feyn`.

### Fixed

- `plot_roc_curve` now correctly computes for large datasets.
- Minor performance improvements to the training.

## [2.1.4] - 2022-01-13

### Fixed
- Release windows versions missing in release 2.1.3.

## [2.1.3] - 2022-01-11

### Changed
- Build for python 3.10 for all major platforms.
- Drop support for python 3.6.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with `np.float128` type not supported on windows machines. Defaults to `numpy.longdouble`.

## [2.1.2] - 2021-12-10

### Added
- `feyn.reference` models now perform automatic categorical preprocessing. This is done using the optional `stypes` parameter in the constructor.

### Changed
- `feyn.plots.plot_model_response_2d` now has a fixed scale for classification to make it easier to read and compare.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where `feyn.tools.estimate_priors` would incorrectly rank the priors in some instances.
- The type checker now allows all numerical numpy dtypes in place of "float" and all integer types for "int", so you no longer have to upcast your dataframes.
- Input name truncation in the model plots now don't truncate if the length would result in a same-length or longer string.

## [2.1.1] - 2021-10-27

### Added
- Sympify:
    - `feyn.tools.sympify()` (also `model.sympify()`) now has parameter `symbolic_cat` that allows you to expand categories to their linear components to make it easier to port or evaluate a sympy expression.
    - `feyn.tools.get_sympy_substitutions` for easily converting a model and a sample to a substitution dictionary for use with `<sympy_expr>.evalf(subs=...)` with the new category changes.
- Exposed convenience functions used by `auto_run` to make it more composable by the user:
    - `feyn.tools.infer_available_threads` tries to guess how many threads you can use. Returns maximum - 1.
    - `feyn.tools.get_progress_label` gives a label for use with `model.show` that displays epoch count and an estimated time to finish (if elapsed seconds are given).
- Experimental feature for IPython environments only: `ql.expand_auto_run` is a function that takes all the same parameters as `auto_run` and creates a runnable code cell with the same code that makes it easier for you to fold out an `auto_run` loop to its primitive components. Note that this contains all of the error handling, general checking and safety measures of `auto_run` that you might not need, but could serve as a starting point.
- Added `model.plot_pr_curve()` to plot precision-recall curves.
- Added `feyn.tools.estimate_priors` function for computing prior probabilities of inputs based on mutual information.
- Added `ql.update_priors` function primitive for updating the QLattice with prior probabilities of inputs.

### Changed
- `feyn.get_diverse_models` is now more likely to return up to n models, and has improved runtime.
- `feyn.tools.get_model_parameters` returns a slightly different structure for categories now. The category is the index, and the weight columns are now named as `{input_name}\[_ix\]}`. This makes it easier to relate to the specific places in the model, for example for use in substituting values in the sympy expression.
- `model.inputs` now returns a unique list of input names.
- The target parameter of models from `feyn.reference` has been renamed `output_name`.

### Fixed
- Sympify model bugs:
    - Numerical input names now work correctly again.
    - Categorical input names are now identifiable if multiple inputs exist in a model with the same name.
    - Input names with sympy reserved characters should be better supported now (the characters get replaced).
- You can now install optional dependencies using `pip install feyn[extras]`
- Fix display of inputs in models that would sometimes result in hard to copy input names.
- Models with categorical registers should now be reproducible with seed and same version of feyn/qlattice.

## [2.1.0] - 2021-09-27

### Added
- Add `feyn.get_diverse_models`. User facing function to get diverse models given their lineage in the QLattice.
- Add `feyn.tools.get_model_parameters` (also `model.get_parameters`). User can extract the parameters of a certain feature in the model as a pandas DataFrame.
- Add option to save various plots:
    - `plot_model_summary` (also `model.plot`) plot as an html file.
    -  plots in the majority of plotting functions.
- Add option to change the figsize of plots in the majority of plotting functions.
- Add more useful display of inputs in model when they share a common beginning.

### Changed
- New QLattice algorithm that vastly improves performance and has better traversal of the search space:
    - `QLattice.update` now expects you to give all the `models` you have - sorted by your metric of choice - and it will figure out how best to update on its own.
    - New format for saving and loading models. Breaks backwards compatibility with previously saved models.
    - `feyn.prune_models` no longer supports `dropout` and `decay` parameters.
- `plot_model_summary` (also `model.plot`):
    - Is intended to plot the most useful metrics and report for your final model, and has been changed to reflect this.
    - Now displays a table of the inputs used in the model.
- `plot_model_signal` (also `model.plot_signal`) no longer plots the summary metrics, and the arguments have changed to reflect this.
- `plot_partial_2d` now has a deprecation warning, use `plot_model_response_2d` (`model.plot_response_2d`) instead.
- `auto_run`:
    - Now sorts best models based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) by default rather than loss.
    - No longer returns multiple models with identical mathematical expressions. This means that any number between one and ten models will be returned.
    - Now estimates a time to completion.
    - Starting models are now copied before being added to the fitting loop, meaning that your original models are left unchanged.

### Removed
- Remove `feyn.best_diverse_models`. Replaced by `feyn.get_diverse_models` which has similar functionality.
- Remove semantic type "bool" which previously only used functions add, multiply, gaussian2. We now recommend using the numerical semantic type instead.
- Remove deprecated `plot_partial`. This functionality is covered by `plot_model_response_1d`.

### Fixed
- `auto_run` has been reprimanded and will now properly honor your selected amount of `threads`.
- The query language can now be used in all cases - there is no longer a limitation to which queries will be feasible.

## [2.0.7] - 2021-08-20

### Added

- More informative error messages and type checks for all top-level functions, such as:
  - Primitives:
    - `ql.auto_run`,
    - `ql.sample_models`,
    - `feyn.sample_models`,
    - `feyn.fit_models`,
    - `feyn.prune_models`,
    - `feyn.best_diverse_models`,
    - `ql.update`,
  - Plotting:
    - `feyn.plots.plot_partial2d`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_roc_curve`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_probability_scores`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_activation_flow`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_model_summary`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_model_response_1d`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_residuals`,
    - `feyn.plots.plot_regression`
- `Model.predict` can now accept `pd.Series`.
- New function added called `Model.plot_signal`. This displays signal flow through model. This is the previous behaviour of `Model.plot`.
- New function `make_regression` and `make_classification` functions available in `feyn.datasets` module. These are wrappers of the sklearn functions in `sklearn.datasets`.
- Feyn now has a native package for Mac with Apple silicon (M1 chip) for Python 3.8 and 3.9

### Changed

- `plot_probability_scores` parameter `h_kwargs` has been replaced with `**kwargs`. Now you can pass histogram kwargs as keyword arguments and not a dictionary
- `Model.plot` now displays performance figures underneath the model signal. For regressors these are:
  - `plot_regression`,
  - `plot_residuals`.
For classifiers these are:
  - `plot_roc_curve`,
  - `plot_confusion_matrix`.

### Removed

- `ql.snapshots` have been removed and the `QLattice` no longer has backup and restore functionality.


## [2.0.4] - 2021-07-07

### Changed

- `plot_partial` is now called `plot_response_1d` (`feyn.plots.plot_model_response_1d`)
    - The named argument `fixed` is now called `input_constraints`
    - `plot_partial` can still be called but now raises a FutureWarning about being deprecated.

## [2.0.1] - 2021-06-29

### Changed

- `model.plot` (`feyn.plots.plot_model_summary`) has been updated:
    - The named argument `test` is now called `compare_data`
    - Now supports `labels` param for custom labels for the summary metrics
    - Now supports a list of `compare data`, if you want to compare multiple things
    - Any additional metric added will be a more condensed column to make it easier to compare with the primary metrics

### Fixed

- Model graphs being cut off by jupyter's viewport in some instances should now be fixed by automatic rescaling to fit in view.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-06-18

### Changed

- `Graph` is now called `Model`
- The `QGraph` no longer exists. Instead you now work on lists of `Model`s.
- No longer directly instantiate a `QLattice`. Instead you call `feyn.connect_qlattice()`.
- The common `feyn` workflow is now contained in one function called `auto_run` which lives on a connected `QLattice`.

- In addition to the above automatic workflow, we now have a more expressive set of functions to replace the old:
  - A list of `Model`s can now be sampled from a connected `QLattice` using `sample_models`. This replaces part of the behaviour of the previous `get_regressor` and `get_classifier` on the `QGraph`.
  - You now fit a list of `Model`s using `feyn.fit_models`. This takes a list of `Model`s as an input and returns a list of fitted `Model`s. This replaces part of the previous fit step on the `QGraph`.
  - You now prune the worst `Model`s from a list using `prune_models`. This replaces part of the previous fit step on the `QGraph`. Default behaviour removes duplicate `Model`s, has a decay function on `Model`s and dropout.
  - You get the best diverse `Model`s using `feyn.best_diverse_models`. This replaces `QGraph.best`.
  - Now that you operate on a list of `Model`s, you have the freedom of using the native python `filter` function.
    - You still have a list of useful `feyn.filter` functions but instead apply to the native python `filter`. These functions are. Refer to the documentation for more details:
      - `Complexity`
      - `ContainsInputs`
      - `ExcludeFunctions`
      - `ContainsFunctions`
  - You can display a `Model` as a graph using the `show_model` function.
    - `show_model` detects whether you are in a `Jupyter` environment and decides what to display.

- Other changes:
  - `plot_summary` is now known as `plot` that lives on a `Model`.
  - The output of `sympify` has changed:
    - Categorical input features are now referenced as `<feature_name>_cat`.
    - Numerical input names get suffixed with `_in`.
    - Underscores and spaces in input names are truncated.
  - `sympify` now supports `include_weights=False` which gives an equation without weights and bias.
  - `sympify` now gives consistent results on up to 15 significant digits.
  - `plot_goodness_of_fit` is now called `plot_regression`.
  - `plot_regression_metrics` has been removed - its uses should be covered by `plot_regression`.

### Added

- `plot_roc_curve` has a `threshold` parameter that will plot on the false positive rate and true positive rate at the given `threshold`.
- `plot_confusion_matrix` has a `threshold` parameter.

### Removed

- Our experimental feature module `__future__` has for now outlived its purpose and has been removed.

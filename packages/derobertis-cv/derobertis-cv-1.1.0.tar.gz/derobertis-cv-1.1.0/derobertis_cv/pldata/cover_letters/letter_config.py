I believe I am an ideal fit at FRBP as a Machine Learning Economist given my related research in market
microstructure, macroeconomics, and economic policy as well as technical skills related to developing economic
models and communicating insights from large quantities of data. 
I have applied machine learning and textual analysis in my research, have given numerous informal seminars 
to fellow Ph.D students on programming topics such as machine learning and Python for research applications, 
and I am widely viewed in the department as a resource on such topics. 
I am familiar with banking supervisory work
from both ends: I was an intern in the Credit Risk department at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and I
worked directly with bank examiners in my role as a Portfolio Analyst rebuilding the models for the Allowance
for Loan and Lease Losses at Eastern Virginia Bankshares. I have a strong interest in regulatory issues in
financial markets and am equally comfortable being both self-guided and a team player providing high-quality
results and recommendations. On a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity for larger cities and we have
family close by so Philadelphia seems like a good fit.

I believe I am an ideal fit at CEU as you are looking for an applicant in the area of
applied econometrics with a focus on machine learning. I have applied machine learning and textual 
analysis in my research, and I have deep expertise in programming and 
data science. I hope to further our understanding on how machine learning can be applied in 
empirical finance and economics research, especially around extracting meaning out of 
the predictions made by such models. Beyond my multiple full undergraduate courses, 
I have given numerous informal seminars to fellow
Ph.D students on programming topics such as machine learning and Python for research applications, 
and I am widely viewed in the department as a resource on such topics. I believe the industry is headed 
more towards quantitative finance, machine learning, and big data, and I would be excited at the opportunity 
to teach students these skills. On a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity for larger
cities, and have been hoping for an opportunity to live abroad from the US, so Vienna and Austria seem like

I believe I am an ideal fit at BU as you are looking for an applicant in the area of
FinTech. My job market paper is focused on cryptoassets and I am exploring research ideas in the 
decentralized finance space enabled by blockchain technology. I have applied machine learning and textual 
analysis in my research, and I have deep expertise in programming and 
data science. I hope to further our understanding on how machine learning can be applied in 
empirical finance and economics research, especially around extracting meaning out of 
the predictions made by such models. Beyond my multiple full undergraduate courses, 
I have given numerous informal seminars to fellow
Ph.D students on programming topics such as machine learning and Python for research applications, 
and I am widely viewed in the department as a resource on such topics. I believe the industry is headed 
more towards quantitative finance, machine learning, and big data, and I would be excited about the opportunity 
to teach students these skills. On a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity for larger cities and we have
family close by so Boston seems like a good fit.

I believe I am an ideal fit at FRBP as you are looking for a researcher to focus on 
digital currencies. My job market paper is focused on cryptocurrencies, and I am 
currently researching the broader decentralized 
finance space. I believe that central bank digital currencies will be necessary 
to retain control over monetary policy by providing some of the same benefits as 
switching to open cryptocurrencies, and would be interested in research and policy evaluation to 
support this objective. I have deep expertise in programming and 
data science involving large data sets. I also have experience evaluating policy through my research
which analyzes the intended and unintended effects of central bank equity market intervention. I have a strong
interest in regulatory issues in financial markets and am equally comfortable being both self-guided and a team
player providing high-quality results and recommendations. On a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity
for larger cities and we have family close by so Philadelphia seems like a good fit.

I believe I am an ideal fit at ICI as an Economist given my related research in market microstructure, macroeconomics,
ETFs,
and economic policy as well as technical skills related to developing economic models and communicating insights
from large quantities of data. I also have experience evaluating policy through my research which analyzes the 
intended and unintended effects of
central bank equity market intervention through the purchasing of ETFs.
I am also familiar with regulatory work from both ends: I was an intern in the Credit Risk
department at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and I worked directly with bank examiners in my role as a
Portfolio Analyst rebuilding the models for the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses at Eastern Virginia Bankshares.
I have a strong interest in regulatory issues in financial markets and am
equally comfortable being both self-guided and a team player providing high-quality results and recommendations. On
a personal level, my wife and I have an affinity for larger cities and we have family close by so DC seems like a good
fit.

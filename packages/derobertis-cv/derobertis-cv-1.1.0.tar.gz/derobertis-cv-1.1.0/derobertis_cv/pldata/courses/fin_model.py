I highly recommend using some outside resources to learn some basic Python as it will allow you
to focus more on the course content. I will be teaching from the basics, but this is not a programming
class so we don't have the time to give the language a proper treatment. In the past, students which started early
with external Python and Excel resources performed well and got more applicable knowledge out of the class.
                
Watching every lecture is important as the knowledge from prior lectures becomes essential 
to understand the later lectures. Beyond the lectures, we will have interactive lab
sessions where you can ask me questions and actively get help with the course material as you work on it. For
the projects, you will need to build upon (directly or indirectly) what you have put together in the lab sessions.
Practice problems will also be provided, and it is encouraged that you complete them
before the projects. Start the projects early as there is considerable work involved. Many students have
said they have been the most challenging and rewarding projects they completed at UF.

If you feel lost at any time, please contact me and I can provide additional help, as the
material will continue to build on itself. You cannot afford to feel lost and do nothing and 
hope it will get better, it will only get worse as the course progresses.

I have taught three courses across two universities and six semesters in a wide variety of formats. 
I have received 4.8/5 evaluations and the Warrington College of Business Ph.D. Student Teaching Award.
I am currently teaching Financial Modeling, a senior capstone course at UF, which is not usually taught 
by Ph.D. students, but an exception was made due to my teaching and technical skills. 
All of my classes teach practical skills in addition to the concepts, and I draw on my experience 
as a portfolio analyst to relate concepts to the real world.

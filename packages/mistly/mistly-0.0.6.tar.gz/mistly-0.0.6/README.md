## Usage
Mistly expects `GENIUS_TOKEN` env variable to be set, otherwise it will crash.
Absolutely brilliant error handling I know.

To get Genius API `CLIENT ACCESS TOKEN` sign up here: https://genius.com/signup_or_login
And just **Generate Access Token**.
Check out their documentation if needed.

## Installation
```
pip install mistly
```

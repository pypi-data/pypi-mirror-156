This package contains several GUI applications using features of the `rotsim2d <https://github.com/gkowzan/rotsim2d>`_ library.
These include:

- `rotsim2d_polarizations`, shows values of all 7 R-factors in the high-J limit
  as a function of polarization angles. To reduce dimensionality, the first
  angle is always set to zero and the user can select which of the remaining
  three angles is fixed. The dependence on the last two angles is shown as 2D
  images.
- `rotsim2d_peak_picker`, shows scatter plot of third-order pathway intensities, clicking on a peak will print out information about pathways contributing to the peak.
- `rotsim2d_waiting_time`, investigate waiting time dependence.

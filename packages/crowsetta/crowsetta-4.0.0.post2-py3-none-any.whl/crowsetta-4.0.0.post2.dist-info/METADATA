## A Python tool to work with any format for annotating animal vocalizations and bioacoustics data

crowsetta provides a Pythonic way to work with annotation formats 
for animal vocalizations and bioacoustics data. 
These formats are used, for example, by 
applications that enable users to annotate audio and/or spectrograms. 
Such annotations typically include the times when sound events start and stop, 
and labels that assign each sound to some set of classes 
chosen by the annotator.
crowsetta has built-in support for many widely used 
[formats](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/index.html),
such as 
[Audacity label tracks](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/seq/aud-txt.html#aud-txt), 
[Praat .TextGrid files](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/seq/textgrid.html#textgrid), 
and [Raven .txt files](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/bbox/raven.html#raven).

Who would want to use crowsetta?
Anyone that works with animal vocalizations 
or other bioacoustics data that is annotated in some way.
Maybe you are a neuroscientist trying to figure out how songbirds learn their song,
or why mice emit ultrasonic calls. Or maybe you're an ecologist studying dialects of finches
distributed across Asia, or maybe you are a linguist studying accents in the
Caribbean, or a speech pathologist looking for phonetic changes that indicate early onset
Alzheimer's disease. crowsetta makes it easier for you to work with 
your annotations in Python, regardless of the format.

## Features

* take advantage of built-in support 
  for many widely used
  [formats](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/index.html),
  such as 
  [Audacity label tracks](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/seq/aud-txt.html#aud-txt), 
  [Praat .TextGrid files](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/seq/textgrid.html#textgrid), 
  and [Raven .txt files](https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats/bbox/raven.html#raven).
* work with any format by remembering just one class:  
  `annot = crowsetta.Transcriber(format='format').from_file('annotations.ext')`
  - no need to remember different functions for different formats 
* when needed, use classes that represent the formats 
  to write readable scripts and libraries 
* convert annotations to common file formats like `.csv`
  that anyone can work with
* work with custom formats that are not built in to `crowsetta` 
  by writing simple classes, leveraging abstractions 
  that can represent a wide array of annotation formats

For examples of these features, please see: https://crowsetta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#features

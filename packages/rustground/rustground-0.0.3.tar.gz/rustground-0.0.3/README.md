# RustGround  - A way to run Rust without having Rust

This is a simple script that wraps the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) API via Python.
Thus allowing you to upload the contents of a single Rust file to the playground, and grabbing the output whatever it may be.

The need for this is only if you would like to run Rust files or Rust programs without being able to install Rust itself.

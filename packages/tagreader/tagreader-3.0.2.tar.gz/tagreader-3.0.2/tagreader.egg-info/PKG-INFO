# Tagreader #

Tagreader is a Python package for reading trend data from the OSIsoft
PI and Aspen Infoplus.21 IMS systems. It is intended to be easy to use,
and present as similar interfaces as possible to the backend historians.

While originally developed for Windows, Tagreader can since release 3.0.0
also be used on Linux and Windows platforms.

Queries can be performed using either REST API (preferred) or ODBC queries.
The use of ODBC queries require installation of proprietary drivers from
AspenTech and OSIsoft that are only available for Windows.

Trend data is output as Pandas Dataframes. The HDF5 file format is used
to cache results.

## Requirements

Python >=3.7 with the following packages:

  + pandas >= 1.0.0
  + tables (*)
  + requests
  + requests-kerberos
  + certifi >= 2020.04.05
  + pyodbc (**)

*) If tables is not installed, caching of fetched data will be disabled.
Tables will be installed alongside Tagreader unless the installation is
known to fail, which is the case for Macs with M1 chip.

**) If using ODBC connections, you must also install proprietary drivers for
PI ODBC and/or Aspen IP.21 SQLPlus. These drivers are only available for
Microsoft Windows. Pyodbc will therefore not be installed for non-Windows
systems.

## Installation

To install and/or upgrade:

```
pip install --upgrade tagreader
```

## Usage example ##

```
import tagreader
c = tagreader.IMSClient("mysource", "aspenone")
print(c.search("tag*"))
df = c.read_tags(["tag1", "tag2"], "18.06.2020 08:00:00", "18.06.2020 09:00:00", 60)
```

0.5 (2021-03-20)
----------------
Enhancement of v0.4.0 (thanks to PyPos3DLO returns)\:

PyPos3DLO:
- delete functions supports channel deletion
- ReportAltMorph can take into account deltas in adjacent others actors.
  Useful when the alternate geometry has been created with parts fusions.
- ImportChannel: New option to hide created dials when they are calculated
- addMaster : New function - Provides the means to create a valueParm at root
  level (BODY) for any actor's dial
- createMorph : New function - Provides the means to create a morph by importing
  a Wavefront file (like Poser). Morph can apply to the default geometry of
  the actor OR to any alternate geometry of it. An optional 'master' dial
  can be specified to control the morph from the character's root (BODY)
- New Button **Open** : Open a file selection window to select any managed file
  and edit it. 
- New Button **View Log** : Read the log file into a dedicated sheets named 'Logs'

pypos3d:
- Extensions to support the new functions above

- Enhancement of Unit Tests coverage and some useless methods removed
- Few bug fixes

Dependencies:
- Tested with GLFW 2.1.0

0.4.0 (2021-02-17)
------------------
This version of this global project delivers an OpenGL 3D viewer for Wavefront files.
This viewer provides the means to observe geometries with simple coloring and texturing
capabilities.

Changes in pypos3d.wftk:
  - Class WFMat added to support simple viewer renderings
  - WaveGeom can read material files (.mtl)

Changes in pypos3d.pftk:
  - Poser customData management added for Figure, PoserMeshedObject


0.3.0 (2020-12-05)
------------------
New decimation function added. The package 'propslim' contains the port of the QSlim algorithm initially developed and distributed by Michael Garland in July 2004 within the "SlimKit Surface Modeling Tools".
This decimate function applies to "WaveGeom" and preserves 'texture' coordinates.

**WARNING**
Original copyrights and credentials are delivered within this independant module.
The original C++ code was GPL2. I don't know about my partial port, I suspect it to be _copylefted_ by it.
If it's not the case, I would choose for 'New BSD license'
For commercial usage in a closed source program, I suggest to remove the package: pypos3d.propslim

Other changes: Few new unit tests to foster relialability.


0.2.0 (2020-11-16)
------------------

Internal structure optim: (for a better code maintenability and few speed improvements)
- Do not differentiate Props and Actors in a Figure (do avoid some Misses)
- Delete class "channels"\: Shall disappear after read, attributs inlined in PoserMeshedObject
- Delete Class "FigureDescription" --> inlined in Figure
- Delete class "AddChildSA" and "weld" and "linkParam"
- Add a consistency method on links

PoserFileParser refactoring:
  --> Read Speed x 6

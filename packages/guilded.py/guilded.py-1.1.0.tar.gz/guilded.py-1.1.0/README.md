Welcome to guilded.py, a discord.py-esque asynchronous Python wrapper for Guilded's user and bot APIs. If you know discord.py, you know guilded.py.

## Documentation

In the works. Fortunately, if you've used discord.py before, you'll already have a head start.

## Basic Example

```py
import guilded

client = guilded.Client()
# If you're using a userbot, you would use UserbotClient() instead.

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('Ready')

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
        return
    if message.content == 'ping':
        await message.channel.send('pong!')

client.run('token')
# If you're using a userbot, you would use an email & password instead of an access token.
```

### Bot example

```py
import guilded
from guilded.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')
# If you're using a userbot, you would use UserbotBot() instead.

@bot.command()
async def ping(ctx):
    await ctx.send('pong!')

bot.run('token')
# If you're using a userbot, you would use an email & password instead of an access token.
```

# Small Feedback Arc Set (sfas)
Efficient implementation of a greedy algorithm for computing small feedback arc sets in directed weighted multi-graphs.
This implementation is an adaptation of the algorithm described in Section 2.3 of [this](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p133-simpson.pdf) article, with additional generalization to support weights and parallel edges.

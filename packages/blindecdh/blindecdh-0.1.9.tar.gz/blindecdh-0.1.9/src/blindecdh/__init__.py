"""
This package implements unauthenticated ECDH between two endpoints.
Authentication can then later be added by, for example, mutual short string
authentication (as exemplified by the simpleauthstrings package).

The exchange happens by using the ECDHProtocol on both sides, exchanging the
peer public key of one instance with the other, and viceversa.  Completed
exchange returns a CompletedECDH instance.

Unless both sides of the ECDH exchange have verified that the derived keys
match, you must not use the derived or shared keys on the CompletedECDH
instances to perform cryptography — otherwise you will be vulnerable to
an active man-in-the-middle attack.

The README.md file included in the package has a simple usage example for this,
as well as suggestions on how to perform the authentication / verification.

This is mostly based on

"""Time resolvers.
Resolvers have a basic signature that they must match. Abstract signature
consists of two constant parameters: the first one takes a string to parse,
the second one - a `model.Tense` object as a container for aliases.

It's worth noting that resolvers must return a string iterator.

How can I create my own resolver? You can see examples in:
    - https://github.com/Animatea/aiotense/tree/main/examples

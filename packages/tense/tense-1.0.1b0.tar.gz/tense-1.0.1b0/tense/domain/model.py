    !!! warning
        If the `multiplier` attribute of this class is less than
        or equal to zero, a warning will be issued to the console,
        since in this case the parsers may not work correctly.

    !!! note
        This class adds each virtual unit of time to `self.__dict__`,
        as it filters values from there in `__iter__` ,method.

        For each virtual unit, a name is generated according to the

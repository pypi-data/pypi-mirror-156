which have two models to execute ChaoseBlade command in the remote server
2. transfer xmind testcase to excel testcase(some formated restrict xmind)
3. transfer swagger url to jmeter scripts
using some opensource packge to complish this
4. transfer har file to jmeter scripts
5. fake data generation base on faker
6. kafka message sender and getter with fileter
7. mqtt message sender and getter with basic filter  
- others code snips, can add into automation testing  
- get data from jmesh  
- get fack data  
- generate test case from xmind  
- get sha1 password  
- http request send and validate  
- time counter wraper  
- multi list to single list  
- mysql operations to quick execute sql  
- redis operations to quick read or write data to it  
- kafka operations to send or get data from target topic  
- mqtt operations to send to receive data from server

- add har2locust or other protocol sender... 
- add some general validate function in the automation testing, like datatype validate,response validate,callback function ...
- add some wrapped function about auto test framework, like pytest or behave 
- deploy jmeter agent to distribute server or docker warapped agent
- retry function in the auto test framework
- mock server will base one config and generate some data

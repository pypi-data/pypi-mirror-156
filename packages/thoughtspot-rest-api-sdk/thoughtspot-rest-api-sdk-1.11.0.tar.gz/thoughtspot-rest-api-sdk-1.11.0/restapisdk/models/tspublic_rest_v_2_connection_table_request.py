    Attributes:
        id (string): GUID of the connection
        configuration (string): A JSON object of the connection metadata. If
            this field is left empty, then the configuration saved in the
            connection is considered.    To get the tables based on a
            different configuration, include required attributes in the
            connection configuration JSON.    Example:    Get tables from
            Snowflake with a different user account than specified in the
            connection:
            {"user":"test_user","password":"test_pwd","role":"test_role"}   
            Get tables from Redshift for different database than specified in
            the connection: {"database":"test_db"}
        include_column (GetConnectionTablesIncludeColumnEnum): When set to
            true, the response will include column level details as well.

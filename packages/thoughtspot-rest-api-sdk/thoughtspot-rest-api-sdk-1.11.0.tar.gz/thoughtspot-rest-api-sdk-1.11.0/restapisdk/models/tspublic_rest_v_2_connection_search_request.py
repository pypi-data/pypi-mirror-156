    TODO: type model description here.

    Attributes:
        offset (int): The offset point, starting from where the records should
            be included in the response.    If no input is provided then
            offset starts from 0.
        batch_number (int): An alternate way to set offset for the starting
            point of the response.    The value in offset field will not be
            considered if batchNumber field has value greater than 0.   
            Offset value will be calculated as (batchNumber - 1) * batchSize. 
            It is mandatory to provide a value for batchSize with
            batchNumber.
        batch_size (int): The number of records that should be included in the
            response starting from offset position. If no input is provided,
            then all records starting from the value provided in offset is
            included in the response.
        sort_by (SearchConnectionSortByEnum): Field based on which the
            response needs to be ordered.
        sort_order (SearchConnectionSortOrderEnum): Order in which sortBy
            should be applied.
        mtype (SearchConnectionTypeEnum): Type of the connect being searched.
            Valid values:
        name_pattern (string): A pattern to match the name of the connection.
            This parameter supports matching case-insensitive strings. For a
            wildcard match, use %.
        fetch_id (list of string): A JSON array containing the GUIDs of the
            connections that you want to fetch.
        skip_id (list of string): A JSON array containing the GUIDs of the
            connections that you want to skip.
        tag (list of TagNameAndIdInput): A JSON array of name or GUID of tags
            or both. When both are given then id is considered

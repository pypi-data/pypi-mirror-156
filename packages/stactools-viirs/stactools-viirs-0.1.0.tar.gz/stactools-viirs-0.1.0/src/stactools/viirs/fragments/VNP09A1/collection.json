    "description": "The 8-day Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) surface reflectance Version 1 composite product provides an estimate of land surface reflectance from the VIIRS sensor for nine moderate resolution bands (M1 - M5, M7, M8, M10, M11) at nominal 1 kilometer resolution (~926 meter). The 1 kilometer dataset is derived through resampling the native 750 meter VIIRS resolution data in the Level 2 input product. The data are corrected for atmospheric conditions such as the effects of molecular gases, including ozone and water vapor, and for the effects of atmospheric aerosols. Each pixel represents the best possible Level 2G observation during an 8-day period that is selected on the basis of high observation coverage, low sensor angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading. Included in the product along with the nine reflectance bands are day of year, reflectance band quality, control, reflectance state quality assurance, relative azimuth angle, sensor zenith angle, and solar zenith angle bands.",

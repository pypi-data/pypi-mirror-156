## Introduction

PyS3 Tower *(like the Pisa Tower, it's a french joke)* is a Python library that can sync your local files to an S3 bucket. With PyS3 Tower you can easily sync your local files to an S3 bucket and also sync your S3 bucket to your local files.

This script works like xcopy on Windows. But it is more powerful, flexible and adapted to the needs of the S3 bucket.

\> PyS3 Tower work with the following rules:
- If a file is in the S3 bucket and not in the local folder, it will be deleted on the bucket,
- If a file is in the local folder and not in the S3 bucket, it will be uploaded to the bucket,
- If a file is in both the local and the S3 bucket, the local file will be updated on the bucket if it is different from the local file.

This project is open source and you can contribute to it on GitHub. It is alson still in development, so if you find a bug or a feature, please open an issue on GitHub (and I think you could find a whole lot of bugs).


## Installation

    pip install pys3tower

*Note: PyPi page is available at: https://pypi.org/project/pys3tower/*


## Usage in your code

Import the PyS3 Tower library:

    import pys3tower

And create a PyS3 Tower object with your local file path, your S3 bucket name, your S3 bucket key and your access key, secret key and region:
    
    pys3tower = pys3tower.PyS3Tower(local_path, s3_bucket_name, s3_bucket_key, access_key, secret_key, region)

Then, run the pysetower.run() method:

    pys3tower.run()

*Note: a better documentation will be available soon.*

## Usage with the command line

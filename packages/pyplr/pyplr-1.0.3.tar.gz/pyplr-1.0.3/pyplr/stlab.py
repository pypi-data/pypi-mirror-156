A python wrapper for Ledmotive's Spectra Tune Lab light engine and RESTful API.
Most documentation comes from the 'LIGHT HUB RESTful API' manual, so please
consult this for further functions and more info. Note that a license is

            `'192.168.6.2'`.

        Note
        ----
        Luminaires have an address assigned automatically when they are
        registered by the LIGHT HUB. This address is used to issue requests to
        that particular luminaire and is referred to within this documentation
        simply as *address*. Whenever an *address* is required, a multicast
        address can be used instead. See `set_multicast_address(...)` to know
        more how to configure multicast addresses.

        Luminaires sharing the same multicast address are considered a group,
        and where this documentation refers to *group #*, it should be read as
        all the luminaires sharing the multicast address #. A special multicast
        address, `1023`, known as the broadcast address, is reserved to refer
        to all the luminaires in the installation.

        Addresses should be within the range 1 and 1022 (reserving 1023 as the
        broadcast address). The LIGHT HUB registers new luminaires assigning
        them the lowest address available. Luminaire addresses are shared with
        multicast addresses, which means a luminaire cannot have an address
        already in use as a multicast address.

        Do not mix luminaires with a different quantity of channels in the same
        group as this might lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when
        using functions with parameters dependent in the luminaire number of
        channels.

        When GET commands are issued using the broadcast address, `1023`, or
        any multicast address, the return value will be from whichever device
        replies first. To avoid ambiguity, GET commands should therefore target
        a unique device address.

        The Mac connection driver usually creates the network in a way that
        places the LightHub device at IP 192.168.6.2 instead of IP 192.168.7.2,
        so this may need to be changed depending on the platform. If that is
        not enough, you might need to also install the two (
        `Network <https://beagleboard.org/static/Drivers/MacOSX/RNDIS/HoRNDIS.pkg>`_
        and
        `Serial <https://beagleboard.org/static/Drivers/MacOSX/FTDI/EnergiaFTDIDrivers2.2.18.pkg>`_
        ) Mac OX drivers required by the BeagleBone (the LightHub motherboard).

        Before a video can be played, the file must be parsed and loaded into

        mechanism that maintains the last 5 launched videos into memory,
        greatly speeding subsequent calls to play the video.

        It is possible to force the LIGHT HUB to parse and load a video in its
        cache without actually starting to play it by requesting the video
        metadata. By doing this with the videos we later want to launch, we can
        obtain a faster response at play time and ease the synchronization of
        the videos, specially for the initial frames.

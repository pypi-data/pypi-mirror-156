introText = 'The software can export powder patterns to .dat files in PSI format and to .xye files. This is done by built in functions. '\
+'The following fuctions are avaliable: *export()*, *add()*, *export_from()*, *export_from_to()* to export measured data to . '\
+'In addition, the function *export_help()* can be used to general help for export functions. '\
+'Help for all export function can also be printed by e.g. *help(export)*. '\
+'In this tutorial we examplify the use of the export functions and the various keywords for the functions.\n \n'\
+'Properties of export functions:\n'\
+' - export(): For export of induvidual sets of scan files. Files can be merged by [] or "" notation, i.e. list or strings.\n'\
+' - add(): The function adds/merge all the files given independent on the notation.\n'\
+' - export_from(): For export of all data files in a folder after a startfile.\n'\
+' - export_from_to(): It exports all files between and including two given file numbers.\n'\
+' - export_list(): Takes a list and export all the files separatly. If a list is given inside the list, the files will be merged.\n'\
+' - subtract(): Takes two file names and subtract the corresponding .dat and .xye files. The function act on exported data files, not on raw data.\n \n'\
+'Most important kewords:\n'\
+' - sampleName (bool): Include sample name from raw file in filename. Default is True.\n'\
+' - dTheta (float): Stepsize of binning if no bins is given (default is 0.125).\n'\
+' - outFile (str): String for name of outfile (given without extension). If not given, an automatic file name will be generated.\n'\
+' - folder (str): Path to directory for data files, default is current working directory.\n'\
+' - outFolder (str): Path to folder data will be saved. Default is current working directory.\n \n'\
+'Example: export(578, dTheta=0.25)\n \n'\
+'Both PSI and xye format files are exported as default. They can be deactivated by the following keywords.\n'\
+' - PSI (bool): Use PSI format. Default is True.\n'\
+' - xye (bool): Use xye format. Default is True.\n \n'\
+'Example: export(578, PSI=False) \n \n'\
+'File names for exported files are by default the sample named stored in the raw file. This can be changed with the following keywords:\n \n'\
+' - sampleName (bool): Use sample name stored in raw file in file name of exported data. Default is True.\n'\
+' - temperature (bool): Include temperature in filename. Default is False.\n'\
+' - fileNumber (bool): Include sample number in filename. Default is False.\n'\
+' - magneticField (bool): Include magnetic field in filename. Default is False.\n'\
+' - electricField (bool): Include electric field in filename. Default is False.\n \n'\
+'Example: export(578, sampleName=False, fileNumber=True)\n \n'\
+'Examples fo use of export functions: \n \n'

Export of diffraction patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The software can export powder patterns to .dat files in PSI format and to .xye files. This is done by built in functions. The following fuctions are avaliable: *export()*, *add()*, *export_from()*, *export_from_to()* to export measured data to . In addition, the function *export_help()* can be used to general help for export functions. Help for all export function can also be printed by e.g. *help(export)*. In this tutorial we examplify the use of the export functions and the various keywords for the functions.
 
Properties of export functions:
 - export(): For export of induvidual sets of scan files. Files can be merged by [] or "" notation, i.e. list or strings.
 - add(): The function adds/merge all the files given independent on the notation.
 - export_from(): For export of all data files in a folder after a startfile.
 - export_from_to(): It exports all files between and including two given file numbers.
 - export_list(): Takes a list and export all the files separatly. If a list is given inside the list, the files will be merged.
 - subtract(): Takes two file names and subtract the corresponding .dat and .xye files. The function act on exported data files, not on raw data.
 
Most important kewords:
 - sampleName (bool): Include sample name from raw file in filename. Default is True.
 - dTheta (float): Stepsize of binning if no bins is given (default is 0.125).
 - outFile (str): String for name of outfile (given without extension). If not given, an automatic file name will be generated.
 - folder (str): Path to directory for data files, default is current working directory.
 - outFolder (str): Path to folder data will be saved. Default is current working directory.
 
Example: export(578, dTheta=0.25)
 
Both PSI and xye format files are exported as default. They can be deactivated by the following keywords.
 - PSI (bool): Use PSI format. Default is True.
 - xye (bool): Use xye format. Default is True.
 
Example: export(578, PSI=False) 
 
File names for exported files are by default the sample named stored in the raw file. This can be changed with the following keywords:
 
 - sampleName (bool): Use sample name stored in raw file in file name of exported data. Default is True.
 - temperature (bool): Include temperature in filename. Default is False.
 - fileNumber (bool): Include sample number in filename. Default is False.
 - magneticField (bool): Include magnetic field in filename. Default is False.
 - electricField (bool): Include electric field in filename. Default is False.
 
Example: export(578, sampleName=False, fileNumber=True)
 
Examples fo use of export functions: 
 


.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from DMCpy import DataSet
   
   # print general help for exporting data.
   DataSet.export_help()
   
   # print help for add() function. 
   help(DataSet.add)    
   
   
   # export(): Exports 565 and 578 induyvidually. The step size for the exported files is 0.25. The data files are located in 'data/' and the exported files are stored in 'docs/Tutorials/Powder'. 
   DataSet.export(565,578,dTheta=0.25,folder=r'data/',outFolder=r'docs/Tutorials/Powder')
   # exports .dat and .xye files of 565 and 578 induvidually.
   
   # export(): Export can also be used to merge files. Here [567,568,570,571] is merged, '570-573' is merged and (574,575) is merged.
   # In the file names of the exported files, the file numbers are given, and not the sample name. 
   DataSet.export([567,568,570,571],'570-573',(574,575),sampleName=False,fileNumber=True,folder=r'data/',outFolder=r'docs/Tutorials/Powder')
   # exports .dat and .xye files of 567_568_570_571, 570-573, 574_575
   
   # add(): Add the files 565,578,579,585,586,587,575 and export one file named 'added_files'. The data files are located in 'data/' and the exported files are stored in 'docs/Tutorials/Powder'. 
   DataSet.add(565,578,579,(585),'586-587',[575],outFile='added_files',folder=r'data/',outFolder=r'docs/Tutorials/Powder')
   # exports 'added_files.dat' and 'added_files.xye'
   
   # export_from_to(): exports all files from 578 to 582. The files are located in 'data/' and the exported files are stored in 'docs/Tutorials/Powder'. 
   # For the automatic filename, sample name is not included, but the file number is included. 
   DataSet.export_from_to(578,582,sampleName=False,fileNumber=True,folder=r'data/',outFolder=r'docs/Tutorials/Powder')
   # exports .dat and .xye files of 578, 579, 580, 581, 582
   
   # subtract(): Subtract two data files from each other. Must have same binning. In this case, only .dat files are subtracted as xye=False. 
   DataSet.subtract('DMC_579','DMC_578',xye=False,outFile=r'subtracted_file',folder=r'docs/Tutorials/Powder',outFolder=r'docs/Tutorials/Powder')
   # create subtracted_file.dat

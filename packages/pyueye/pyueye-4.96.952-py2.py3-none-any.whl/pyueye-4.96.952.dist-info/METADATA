Description
-----------
pyueye is a lean wrapper implementation of Python function objects that represent uEye API functions. As there is no intelligence in the pyueye interface, it is as near as possible to the uEye C API and always up-to-date. Benefit from many Python advantages, for example the interactive programming of your uEye camera. Write and test small code snippets without the complex setup of a programming IDE with a toolchain. The pyueye interface is ideal for prototyping uEye camera applications for all supported uEye platforms (Windows, Linux, Linux Embedded). The pyueye interface is compatible to previous versions of the IDS Software Suite. Further information on the pyueye versions can be found in the [release notes](https://en.ids-imaging.com/files/downloads/ids-software-suite/interfaces/release-notes/python-release-notes_EN.html)


Installation
------------
> pip install pyueye

Quickstart
----------

    from pyueye import ueye

    h_cam = ueye.HIDS(0)
    ret = ueye.is_InitCamera(h_cam, None)

    if ret != ueye.IS_SUCCESS:
        pass

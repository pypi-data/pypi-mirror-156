# yagls
Yet Another Github Label Synchroniser.
## Inspiration
I wanted to labeling well. But I'd no idea, so I found well-labeled project.

Also I found another Github Label Synchroniser, but It wasn't fit to me.

To me, that wasn't intuitive. That worked well, but I didn't like that.

So I decided to make new Github Label Synchroniser.
## Feather
Just copy labels from repository and paste to repository.

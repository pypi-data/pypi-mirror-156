V1.6.0:

- [#47] Add a 'api-key' parameter to the Interactive

        (trying to) use it immediately.


V1.4.0:

- [#37] Allow to override the URL in the credentials with a command-line
        argument (in the Interactive) or a constructor argument (in the

        the known regions).

V1.3.1:

- Update the documentation in README.md
- Update the sample session in README.md


V1.3.0:

- [#34] 'dump' downloads and stores all the inputs and outputs of a job,
        so that all the data is readily available. Replaces 'output', which
        is now deprecated.
- [#33] Print status of job while waiting for completion.


V1.2.0:

- [#32] 'output' downloads the output data assets, not just inline outputs.
- [#31] The 'log' command wouldn't work if the job used 'outputs assets'.

        not interrupted.

        as last resort.

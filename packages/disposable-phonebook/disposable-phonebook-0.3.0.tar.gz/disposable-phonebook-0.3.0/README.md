# disposable-phonebook

Collect "disposable" phone numbers from various internet sites that offer
"receive free SMS to an anonymous number" functionality.

```bash
$ dphonebook scrape
[{"number": "+16462879071", "area": "New York", "provider": "receive-smss.com", "last_message": 1652437175, "last_checked": 1652438795},
{"number": "+16466623058", "area": "New York", "provider": "receive-smss.com", "last_message": 1652437776, "last_checked": 1652438796}]
```

This is useful to online service providers, who want to restrict usage of such numbers
on customer profiles, for security reasons (avoiding publicly available 2FA codes).

$ pip3 install disposable-phonebook

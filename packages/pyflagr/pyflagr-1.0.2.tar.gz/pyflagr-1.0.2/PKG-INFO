FLAGR is a high performing, modular library for rank aggregation. To ensure the highest possible performance, the core FLAGR library is written in C++ and implements a wide collection of unsupervised rank aggregation methods. Its modular design allows third-party programmers to implement their own algorithms and easily rebuild the entire library. FLAGR can be built as a standard application, or as a shared library (so or dll). In the second case, it can be linked from other C/C++ programs, or even from programs written in other languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.). In this context, PyFLAGR is a Python library that links to FLAGR and allows a developer to exploit the efficient FLAGR implementations from a standard Python program.

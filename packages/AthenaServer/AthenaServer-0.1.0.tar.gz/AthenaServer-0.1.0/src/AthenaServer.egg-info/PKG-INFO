## Package Details
#### Details and features 
- A general server system for Directive Athena Applications
- Isn't dependent on 3rd party packages, except for those that have been created by [@AndreasSas](https://github.com/AndreasSas)
  - These can be designated by the leading "*Athena*..."
  - These packages aren't seen as a 3rd party dependency as they are all made by the "same party"

#### Python Version
- Supported Python versions: **3.10**
  - Other older versions of Python are not currently supported. 
  - These older versions will probably not be supported by [@AndreasSas](https://github.com/AndreasSas) himself, but if you want to contribute to the project and make this package compatible with older versions of Python, Pull requests are always welcome.
